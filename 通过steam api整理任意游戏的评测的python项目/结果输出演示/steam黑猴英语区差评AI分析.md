# 《steam黑猴英语区近180天差评整理》分析报告 —— kimi 1.5

## 一、主要问题类型及代表性差评示例

### （一）游戏性能与优化问题
- **帧率不稳定与性能不足**：
    - “For starters, the game's performance is unstable at best, even on my 3080ti, i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, liquid cooled machine. It constantly and unexpectedly dipped down to laughably low frame rates to the point that I thought the game was being ran by Microsoft Power Point, even with most of the settings on low and medium, RTX off, DLSS set to performance and frames capped at 120. Unacceptable.”（首先，即使在我配备3080ti显卡、i9处理器、32GB内存和水冷系统的机器上，游戏的性能也极不稳定。帧率会频繁且意外地降到令人发笑的低水平，低到让我以为游戏是用Microsoft Power Point运行的，即使大部分设置调到低和中，RTX关闭，DLSS设为性能模式，帧率上限设为120。这让人无法接受。）
    - “The game has enough recommendations already so I choose to put this review on the not recommended section, click bait aside I do think that the game is over rated. I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game. The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map. I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there are thousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side. The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story. Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve. You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers. Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue. Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues. Overall it's a solid first AAA Chinese game but they need to improve their story telling for their next game.”（这款游戏已经有足够的推荐，所以我选择将这条评价放在不推荐的部分。抛开标题党不谈，我认为这款游戏被高估了。我不是灵魂类游戏的玩家，也很少玩动作导向的游戏，但我习惯于玩其他需要大量尝试和练习才能享受的游戏，因此我没有对游戏的难度感到震惊。这款游戏只是稍微开放的世界，在地图上散落着一些支线任务，整体感觉大多是线性的，除了最后一章，游戏突然变得更加开放，地图的处理方式也少了一些线性。我认为描述这款游戏的游戏玩法和优点是没有用的，你可以阅读和观看成千上万的其他评价，但对我来说，这款游戏最大的缺点在于叙事方面。叙事是支离破碎的，需要你对原始素材有一定的熟悉程度，并且需要你对中国社会文化背景以及佛教和道教有一定的了解才能充分欣赏故事。对我来说另一个不好的地方是，大部分游戏世界构建的背景知识都锁定在游戏暂停菜单中，只有在你遇到或击败敌人后才会解锁，我认为这是灵魂类游戏的一个特点，但作为一个RPG玩家，我认为这是一个巨大的失败，因为它与试图让你沉浸在游戏中世界的RPG相反，在这里它成为了干扰，完全不具有沉浸感。你可以从YouTube上获取这些背景知识，但作为一个独立的游戏和故事，这是开发者方面的巨大失败。除此之外，从性能方面来看，这款游戏延续了UE5游戏的传统，有时可以提供令人惊叹的画面，但有时却不尽如人意，充满了卡顿和不合理的性能问题。更糟糕的是，不知何故，这款游戏没有原生的HDR支持，我可以通过编辑.ini文件来启用UE5的HDR，但这会导致UI重影问题。超宽21：9是原生支持的，但存在一些小问题。总的来说，这是一款坚实的中国第一款AAA游戏，但他们在下一款游戏中需要改进讲故事的方式。）
- **游戏崩溃与启动问题**：
    - “I'm sure this game is great, but I cannot get it to launch for the second day in a row. The other day I got to the main menu, capped my FPS, played for 3 hours, and when I logged on today, I couldn't load the game. I've spent more time trying to troubleshoot this garbage, than I have played. In addition to running -dx11/dx12 in the Launch options, I've also added permissions for the related executables. Votes are in the negative until this is fixed. intel 12k 3080 SSD Edit: Refund was accepted.”（我确定这款游戏很棒，但我无法连续第二天启动它。前几天我进入了主菜单，限制了我的FPS，玩了3个小时，今天登录时，我无法加载游戏。我花在排除这个垃圾问题上的时间比我玩的时间还多。除了在启动选项中运行-dx11/dx12外，我还为相关可执行文件添加了权限。在修复之前，投票为负面。英特尔12k 3080固态硬盘编辑：退款已接受。）
    - “I had really high hopes for this game since I am a big fan of souls games but in the end because of nonstop bossfights, repetitive foot soldiers, and a map that should be open world but isn't, the game did not live up to my expectations. Along with this even though I have a fairly decent pc that ran elden ring fine, it struggled severly with this game for whatever reason. There was constant lag spikes no matter what settings i ran on, the game took 30 years to boot up, and I was forced to play the game on all low graphics since if I upped them at all they would be unplayable. In the end it isn't the worst game ever but the poor optimization and repetitiveness make it much less enjoyable than the other souls games i have played.”（我对这款游戏抱有很高的期望，因为我是个灵魂类游戏的忠实粉丝，但最终由于不断的Boss战、重复的步兵和一个应该是开放世界却不是的地图，这款游戏没有达到我的期望。除此之外，尽管我有一台相当不错的电脑，运行《艾尔登法环》毫无问题，但不知何故，这款游戏却运行得很吃力。无论我设置成什么，都会出现持续的卡顿峰值，游戏花了30年才启动，而且我被迫以全低画质运行游戏，因为如果我把画质调高一点，游戏就无法玩了。总的来说，这并不是有史以来最糟糕的游戏，但糟糕的优化和重复性让它比我去玩过的其他灵魂类游戏要逊色得多。）

### （二）游戏玩法与内容问题
- **游戏内容单一与重复**：
    - “The core gameplay loop is: 1. sluggishly traverse through an uninteresting area 2. kill trash mobs until you stumble across a boss 3. spend an hour learning its gimmicky move set 4. finally beat it and repeat, that's it”（核心游戏循环是：1. 慢吞吞地穿越一个毫无趣味的区域 2. 杀死杂兵直到你碰到一个首领 3. 花一个小时学习它花哨的招式 4. 最终击败它并重复，就这样）
    - “This game is unforgiving, no difficulty adjustment, and not a lot of fun when dying dozens of times. A game should be challenging to the point where you can get your teeth into it, a determination to beat the enemy, and marvel in your victory! This game is non of that. Instead I found myself dying within 2 hits, 3 or 4 if i put sparks in to Robust Constitution. For those who are used to playing these types of games this is obviously easier but for the standard player this is simply not a fun game as the constant dying with no progression is demoralising.”（这款游戏毫不留情，没有难度调整，当你死去几十次时，乐趣也不多。一款游戏应该具有挑战性，让你能够全身心投入，有击败敌人的决心，并为你的胜利感到惊奇！这款游戏完全没有这些。相反，我发现自己在两击之内就死了，如果我把火花放进强健体格里，可能三四下。对于那些习惯玩这类游戏的人来说，这显然更容易，但对于普通玩家来说，这根本不是一款有趣的游戏，因为不断的死亡没有进展是令人沮丧的。）
- **游戏机制缺乏深度**：
    - “The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES.”（战斗几乎就是整个游戏，从一个首领到另一个首领，中间有一些小规模的战斗。这些战斗非常具有惩罚性，但感觉如此是因为首领们被人为地设置得很困难。我只能通过一个例子来解释：在遇到一个首领并多次死亡后，你学会了首领的招式，能够躲避它们的攻击并把握你的攻击时机。然而，即使在你这样做了之后，你才会意识到首领仍然有三分之二的血量，你必须完美地战斗……还要再打5次。）
    - “The other negative reviews have already covered most of it. I can just add that I too find the game very frustrating. I want to love it, but the poor combat design, getting locked into animations far too often, which punishes you constantly, bonks my monke brain far too often. The movement and dodging also feels very poorly implemented. It feels like you have constant input lag. When you land a heavy attack it doesn't feel rewarding because of the randomness (sometimes you get interrupted, sometimes you don't). The level design is very strange, in a bad way. You get tired of trying to reach places and explore because of the inconsistent and invisible walls. The bosses doesn't feel significant or interesting since you stumble upon new ones constantly. No build-up or back story to get the excitement up before the next boss. I'm not even going to get started on ranged enemies. No FOV adjustment. Extreme over-sharpening of the graphics with no ability to turn it off RUINS the beauty. Camera movement is incorrectly implemented and extremely annoying. No HDR-support and there are raised black levels (no true blacks). A lot of graphical artifacts, mostly noticeable around the character. Also plenty of stuttering.”（其他负面评价已经涵盖了大部分内容。我只想补充说，我也觉得这款游戏非常令人沮丧。我想爱上它，但糟糕的战斗设计，频繁地被锁定在动画中，这会不断惩罚你，让我这个猴子脑袋经常感到困惑。移动和躲避也感觉非常糟糕。感觉你有持续的输入延迟。当你发动重攻击时，由于随机性（有时你会被打断，有时不会），这并不会让人感到满足。关卡设计非常奇怪，而且是坏的方面。由于不一致和看不见的墙壁，你会厌倦尝试到达地方和探索。首领们并不会让人觉得重要或有趣，因为你不断遇到新的首领。在下一个首领之前没有铺垫或背景故事来提升兴奋感。我甚至还不想开始谈论远程敌人。没有视野调整。图形的过度锐化无法关闭，这破坏了美感。相机移动实现错误，非常令人讨厌。没有HDR支持，黑色级别被提升（没有真正的黑色）。角色周围有很多图形伪影。还有很多卡顿。）

### （三）游戏设计与体验问题
- **地图与探索设计不佳**：
    - “The game's scenery is so ridiculously bland that everything looks the same to me. There are no useful land marks and no map/minimap, so you're constantly getting lost and back tracking in circles. On top of that, they do absolutely nothing to make you 'feel' like a monkey God while running around. You have a basic sprint and that's it. No cool flips. No world interaction. No wall runs. No climbing. No swinging. No staff tricks. Not even a double jump... It is painfully boring to run around in this game and OMG the amount of invisible walls and dead ends that should be explorable is infuriating.”（游戏的风景如此单调，以至于在我看来所有东西都一个样。没有有用的地标，也没有地图/小地图，所以你会不断迷路，绕圈子回到原地。除此之外，他们在让你“感觉”像一个猴神方面什么都没做。你有一个基本的冲刺，就这样。没有酷炫的空翻。没有与世界的互动。没有墙跑。没有攀爬。没有摆动。没有法杖技巧。甚至连双跳都没有…… 在这款游戏中跑来跑去是痛苦的无聊，天哪，那些本可以探索的隐形墙和死胡同的数量令人愤怒。）
    - “The map design is not well done. Performance is bad. Not a good game.”（地图设计得不好。性能很差。这不是一款好游戏。）
- **游戏难度与平衡性问题**：
    - “It is more frustrating than rewarding and when you finally beat something, you won't feel accomplished, you'll just be happy you got lucky enough to beat the enemy's gimmick one time after hours of failure with nothing to look forward to except doing it all over again in about 10ft.”（这更多的是令人沮丧而不是有回报，当你最终击败某个东西时，你不会感到有成就感，只会高兴你足够幸运，在经历了数小时的失败后，除了在大约10英尺的地方再做一次之外，没有什么可期待的。）
    - “The bosses are beautifully crafted and have very imaginative designs that ultimately don't matter because they all seem to have the same basic concept: Rush-down AI, spam attacks, then reset every so often. It felt like I was fighting the same boss reskinned over and over and over, even after 20+ hours of play time.”（首领们制作精美，设计非常有想象力，但最终这并不重要，因为它们似乎都有相同的基本概念：冲锋型人工智能，不断攻击，然后每隔一段时间重置。感觉我像是在和同一个首领反复战斗，即使我已经玩了20多个小时。）

### （四）游戏文化与故事问题
- **文化理解门槛高**：
    - “The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.”（叙事是支离破碎的，需要你对原始素材有一定的熟悉程度，并且需要你对中国社会文化背景以及佛教和道教有一定的了解才能充分欣赏故事。）
    - “The problem is that the story is just kind of there. It doesn't really go anywhere and there's no real resolution at the end.”（问题是故事只是在那里。它并没有真正走向任何地方，最后也没有真正的解决。）
- **故事叙述与呈现问题**：
    - “The story and world design. Like many Souls-like games, the narrative is handled poorly—it doesn’t engage or motivate. The setting feels geared only toward a Chinese audience; many will find its bizarre creatures and designs off-putting.”（故事和世界设计。像许多类魂游戏一样，叙事处理得很糟糕——它无法吸引人或激励人。这种设定感觉只针对中国观众；许多人会觉得它奇怪的生物和设计令人反感。）
    - “The game barely indicates where to find key characters or locations, making it easy to skip important upgrades or merchants (sometimes even in the first chapter!).”（游戏几乎没有指示在哪里可以找到关键角色或地点，很容易错过重要的升级或商人（有时甚至在第一章！）。）

## 二、总结出现频率最高的问题
