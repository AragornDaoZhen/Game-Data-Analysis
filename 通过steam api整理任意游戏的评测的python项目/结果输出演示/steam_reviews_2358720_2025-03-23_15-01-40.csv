2025-02-20 19:59,79.2,推荐,"Wukong is an excellent game with some minor flaws.   The combat is great, soulslike without being so difficult that I want to bury my controller in the garden. The environments are incredible, and the plot is awesome.  I've clocked 80 hours over two months, which is made up of two full playthroughs and getting every single achievement, bar one minor thing (I'll get to that)   A couple of downsides; 1. And this is the only one that really bothered me - Invisible walls. As I said the level design is great and I want to explore every corner of it, so it really breaks the immersion when I want to go in one direction only to be stopped by an unforeseen barrier.  2. NG+ felt a bit like NG- - I flew through it the second time through beating bosses first try that would have previously taken me 10 attempts  3. This one is probably a more broader issue for completionists in these sort of games. Boring, grindy achievements. After travelling many distant lands, making friends and foes, and fighting a court of gods. I find myself unable to pop the platinum because I can't find one seed. My gameplay will end with me hopping on every hour or so, once the plants have replenished just to hope the RNG gods will let have a fire date seed.   All that said, no game is perfect, and Wukong is one of the best games I've played in a long time, I'd recommend it to anyone.",165,0.923606514930725098,76561198077709601,79.3,56
2024-09-28 07:55,104.7,推荐,"[h1]Genre: Action-Adventure/Mythology[/h1]  This game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku.   I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.  The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.  The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.  When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.  The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.  Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.  Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.  In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.  Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.  [h1]Pros:[/h1] - One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen - Incredibly fun combat - Journal entries are so interesting - Cutscenes are amazing - Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses - Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting  [h1]Neutral:[/h1] - Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but it's also really interesting  [h1]Cons:[/h1] - Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses  [h1]Verdict:[/h1] Just an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books and this is definitely one of my new favorite games.

2024-10-06 16:14,54.5,推荐,"Imagine coming home after a long 9-to-5, ready to unwind, and Steam download of this game is finished. You said, ""I’ve never played a Souls-like game before—how hard can it be? It can't be that bad, right?""  Wrong.  This game delivers a masterclass in getting your ass whooped. Expect zero handholding—no map, no mission tracker, and constant threat of getting ganged up by random yaoguais. And just when you think you're getting the hang of it, you find out that farming licorice can randomly drop… a goat skull. Yeah, wrap your head around that one.  It's like dating a dominatrix. It's stunning—seriously, the visuals are gorgeous—but it’s going to torment you.  Despite being a first-timer in this genre, getting wrecked repeatedly, I found myself oddly committed—to the challenge, to its captivating lore, to the game itself. I laughed, I cried, I raged, and I teetered on the brink of uninstalling this game more times than I can count.  But after countless gruelling hours, unlocking the secret ending, rerunning New Game+, I finally got that Final Fulfillment achievement. Now, at long last, I can uninstall this tormenting masterpiece with peace...",236,0.880032837390899658,76561199560315104,57.4,65
2024-10-25 14:28,54.4,推荐,"This game in my opinion should be game of the year. Healing can be a bit unresponsive as it does not delay the input if you get knocked down and try to take a quick swig while getting back up but once you get past that it's a really amazing game. Great story and a world inspired by Chinese mythology and The Journey to the West. I really liked the perfect dodge system and the ability to change my build at any resting point to really let me try everything out. I fought every boss, meditated in every location, and met all the characters for the journal and I enjoyed the entire experience. Baije was amazing and really added a lot to the Destined One's journey; I think his last few lines of dialogue in the game was my favorite part. It is not as challenging as FROM software titles but to me it played a lot like Elden Ring with its own unique style and I had a lot of fun with it. I am looking forward to any DLC news for this game in the future. A rare 10/10 experience.",174,0.875927448272705078,76561198042558555,54.4,0

2025-03-03 03:45,208.3,推荐,"As someone who didn't even know the game was coming out and was in the making for years, this was a pleasant surprised.  I am Chinese so all of the story is very familiar, however, even if you didn't have a childhood of Wukong stories, lots of Animes and media today includes parts of the mythology, like Goku from dragon ball, abilities from Naruto and so on.  The story on its own is incredibly interesting, the game tells the narrative in a unique way through out the game and especially the special animations at the end of each chapter. So if you are a story / campaign type player, you are definitely not left out. Also, if you happen to be familiar with the actual story itself, you will understand lots of the characters and references quickly as you play.  On the gameplay side of things, it plays like a souls game, but with extra steps. Invincibility frames on the dodge, bosses having patterns to recognise and defend against, stamina on attacks and movement, bonfire type check points and healing potions. What differs is the in depth combat mechanics like ""see through"" or ""rock solid"" which are basically parries, along side with other spells to change the style of play. All of the options give each player the ability to form their own build and gameplan depending on what they like.  Graphics in this game is just fantastic, I have never seen anything like it. From the environment, to entities, to the exceptionally well made cut scenes, everything just looks perfect. Personally, I haven't had a single case of performance issues, but you can't just take it from me alone, all of my friends who play the game also do not recall having any problems with performance.  Lastly, I just want to talk about content. There are several chapters in the game, each with different lengths. The base game without any side quests seems like any other story game, not too long, not short. However, as you play, you start to see the enormous amount of endless secrets hidden within each chapter, some you find simply with luck. Each chapters secret content can give you a leg up on the final boss of the chapter. Chapter 1 simply gives you a separate boss arena and an additional boss, however compared to chapter 4, where you can stumble upon a whole another chapter within that chapter. All of these side quests leads up to more secret content in the final chapter, which ultimately will allow you to achieve the secret ending.  Great game.",25,0.722215950489044189,76561199364067815,208.3,32

It's a fun game to play, not as hard and challenging as Souls games except for some minibosses(After getting stronger you can come back and defeat them. I might have struggled because I was a bit stubborn but some of them really felt unfair.). The action is pretty good but both combos and spells lack variety. There are different stances but they only change your heavy attack, so you end up using the same light attack combo throughout the entire game. Some upgrades allow you to modify your light attacks but it's still not enough.  Enemies between bosses feel too random and sometimes meaningless. Chapters 5 and 6 seem rushed for the deadline. I like the art style and the graphics are way too good. However, the worst thing about this game is the INVISIBLE WALLS.. there are too many of them and you can't go where you should actually be able to. There might be a better solution for this but it seems the game might have been rushed.

From the moment I started, I was captivated by its stunning visuals, challenging combat, and the rich world it creates, steeped in Chinese mythology.  The gameplay is intense and rewarding. Every fight feels meaningful, requiring patience and strategy, and the boss battles are on another level. I loved how the game balances moments of high-stakes combat with quieter, reflective exploration it gives you time to soak in the incredible atmosphere.  But what truly blew me away was the story. It’s emotional, layered, and beautifully told, with a depth that makes you care deeply about the journey and the characters you encounter along the way. The final cutscene, especially, hit me hard, it was the perfect culmination of everything the game had built up to.  And then there’s the art. This game is a masterpiece in terms of design. Every detail, from the environments to the creatures, feels alive and meticulously crafted. Pair that with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, and you’ve got a game that fully immerses you in its world.  Is it perfect? Maybe not there are some difficulty spikes and minor quirks, but honestly, they’re part of what makes this game so memorable. It doesn’t hold your hand, and that’s exactly why the victories feel so satisfying.  If you’re even remotely interested in action games or mythology, this is a must-play.

[/b]   [h1] ""Black Myth: Wukong"" — 9.6/10 [/h1] ""Black Myth: Wukong"" can be described as an exceptionally outstanding piece of art. Whether it’s the smooth combat experience, rich combat techniques, magical artifacts, diverse bosses, or the exquisite graphics and delightful music—everything is truly remarkable. ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is undoubtedly one of the best games currently available!   [h1] Combat Experience: 8.8/10 [/h1] In ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" players can switch between three different staff techniques at any time during combat. Each technique is suitable for dealing with various types of minor enemies, bosses, and larger foes. Additionally, there are multiple skills available, such as ""Stun Technique,"" ""Invisibility,"" and ""Boss Transformation,"" along with specific weapons designed to counter particularly challenging enemies.  However, a minor drawback is that the game lacks pre-input commands, making the ""Counter"" mechanism dependent on the player's memory of boss attacks, quick judgment, and timing during strikes. This can make it difficult to trigger the ""Counter,"" and dodging may sometimes feel sluggish. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by replacing the staff with a spear.   [h1] Game Music and Graphics: 10/10 [/h1] You can't help but admire how beautiful the music, in-game visuals, and chapter animations are, allowing players to immerse themselves in the mythical world of ancient China. If you have the budget, I highly recommend purchasing the upgraded DLC to enjoy the in-game music album!   [h1] Game Story: 9/10 [/h1] The story of ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is primarily told through fragmented narratives. However, by reading the in-game background stories and combining them with the original novel ""Journey to the West,"" you will be amazed to discover that the game not only includes personal growth and struggle but also embodies the revolutionary spirit inherited from the predecessor (Sun Wukong), fighting to break the cycle and striving for the happiness, equality, and freedom of the common people. Additionally, by exploring each character’s background story, players can gain a profound understanding of the vast worldview set in ""Black Myth,"" including the greed, anger, love, and the true goodness of every monster, character, and deity.

2024-12-25 22:46,65.9,推荐,"[b]Wukong is a game worth every penny, offering a rich experience despite a few flaws.[/b]  The gameplay blends martial arts with a more forgiving souls-like approach, using three combat stances that add some layer of strategy during combat, besides some special abilities. Although the movesets are repetitive, the action remains delightful throughout the whole campaign. The multitude of transformations also help to keep the gameplay appealing.  Performance issues are present but don’t ruin the fun. Even when playing on the most recent hardware, occasional stuttering occurs.  Visually, this game is nothing short of stunning. I found myself stopping more than a few times because the world is so beautifully crafted. Characters are engaging, and the story, inspired by Journey to the West, draws you in.  The biggest immersion breaker are the invisible walls scattered throughout the game. What makes it frustrating is the inconsistency: you can’t always predict where they’ll be, so you’re forced to test boundaries constantly.  The voice acting is top-notch. From the sound effects of every weapon clash to the soundtrack, there's nothing to complain about the audio department. It’s so immersive and high quality.  One of the game's standout features is its impressive roster of over 100 bosses. Each one unique and hand crafted. While most bosses are tough but fair, there are around five or six that stand out as especially brutal, echoing the signature of the genre.  One last significant downside of the game is the input buffering. In high-pressure moments when precision matters most, the game can miss your inputs, leading to frustration.  Despite some few issues, Wukong’s beautiful visuals, satisfying combat, and engaging characters make it a game well worth playing. If you're considering buying this game, don’t wait for any sale or discount: this title is worth every cent. It may not be perfect, but it delivers a fulfilling experience.",44,0.657762348651885986,76561198303671277,65.9,119

That is if you're also into action games, while it can be difficult for some but it's definitely worth playing.[/i][/h1]  [i]Not trying to be bias here, but the game's a blessing in a way for most of us, as JTTW fans. To be fair I've not watched the OG 1986 Journey to the West, only 96' TVB version and some other films.. it may not be the greatest adaptation, however I did enjoy the show as a kid. Been waiting for the game since the first trailer around 4 years ago, it did not disappoint.[/i]  Timeline is set after JTTW, basically like a sequel, the story seemed to be very well-thought-out. A masterpiece, I'd say. The lore and backstory may be confusing for players who aren't familiar with JTTW though, some are explained in the ""Journal"", they're long but pretty interesting read. It's not perfect still, due to some flaws such as some minor lighting bugs, camera angles on certain fights and invisible walls in most areas. Game design is alright, there is no map nor indicator so it may be an issue for anyone with [i]fish[/i] memory and/or just couldn't travel around the place much due to time constraint. The objectives/side quests doesn't show anywhere so players need to observe and listen to what the NPCs' are saying which may indicate something along the story as well. Just don't go diving into the game expecting it to be like some sort of chill RPG, or wise you'd be greatly disappointed. You don't get to beat small baddies much, because you'll run into bosses as you progress the story. Game completion time varies, main story can be completed in less than 50 hours, it would definitely go higher if you'd also do other objectives. Do note that some quests/objectives are highly missable in the run. Game visual looks absolutely stunning, the animations and arts are very impressive too. Soundtracks are great, especially the final boss part. Combat is pretty decent, great variety of abilities to choose from. Often times activating abilities and healing feels like there's a delay to it though, perhaps that's just how it's intended to be in the game. Difficulty-wise it starts off souls-like kinda style, but as the player progress on upgrading better stats after (presumably around Chapter 2-3) it will eventually feel more of a hack n' slash.. I find some of the bosses are tough to beat still. One thing to note is that Chapter 6 feels rather rushed, I got lost long enough trying to figure out where to go and what to do. Nevertheless I've beaten the game (aside from missing a few quests) at 110+- hours with [b]Spell Bind[/b] most of the time, occasionally with a few stat boost from medicine. There's just lots of stuff to do in the game, that said it's quite time consuming for achievement hunters.  Despite some of those mentioned flaws but the game's easily 10/10 for me.

2025-01-18 05:49,38.6,推荐,"As the game which was sort of advertized by media to be ""the first Chinese AAA game"", I would say that Black Myth Wukong certainly lived up to my expectations. With a thrilling world based on mythology with Yaoguais offering all sorts of unique species, it is truly a world to enjoy. However, alongside the praise certainly comes some major criticisms that highly impacted my enjoyment in the long run.  Starting off I naturally want to give some praises where due, which include but are not limited to: + The visual storytelling and cinematics are beyond amazing + Incredibly nice graphics and a beautiful world to explore + A wide variety of bosses offering unique fighting styles and challenges + A dynamic and enjoyable fighting style of the Destined One makes it very engaging and you don't grow tired of it throughout the game.  But here then, are things that for me hold it back from even dreaming of a 10/10 rating. - I'll start off with by far the worst part of the game, and that's how easily missable extra content is. Playing this game without a step by step guide or spoiling for yourself, will guarantee content being locked away. And that's the worst part! Not only is it missable, but the game with actively lock it away for the rest of the playthrough if you make certain progresses. I missed out on an essential storyline of which gives the secret ending of the game, and of which barred me from multiple secret bosses, for, and I kid you not, not finding and talking to a certain NPC, hiding behind a certain pillar, within a certain temple, within a certain temple district, in Chapter 3. And because I failed to notice him even being there, he despawned FOREVER when I progressed to chapter 4, so I couldn't even go back to continue the quest. This one hidden NPC locked me away from half a dozen bosses, and the secret ending. And there are practically no cues for you to expect them to be somewhere, nor what will cause them to disappear. It's utter bs and so if you want to experience everything within one playthrough, you HAVE to follow a guide to make sure you not only do everything but also IN THE RIGHT ORDER, cause the game sure as hell doesn't explain it. - Chapter 4 has a segment of the big area of which many experience major frame drops, this is due to webbing in caves and alike, and as a result I would recommend for anyone entering chapter 4, to go into their settings and to turn ""Hair Quality"" to low so that you won't lose out on performance. My RTX 3080 struggled holding even 60fps otherwise.  - Certain bosses have some really bs attacks or abilities that can get really annoying to deal with. I get it, Wukong is a hard game with hard bosses, and I don't complain about that. I beat every boss the game allowed me to fight. HOWEVER, I don't think it's reasonable difficulty, when say, a certain boss just spawns tornadoes that stunlock you with zero indication and reason, or when you're knocked out of a heavy attack moments before it lands over the weakest of moves, or when the boss enters a sort of animation when transitioning between phases, of which it temporarily leaves itself open EXCEPT YOU CAN'T TO ANY DAMAGE (multiple bosses are guilty of this but none worse than Cloudtreading Deer). There is no worse feeling than thinking the boss is open for a major blow so you unleash a big heavy, or maybe a powerful spell move, like a vessel or alike, just for everything to be nullified cause he's just preparing for what to do next and you can't just hurt him when he's in the middle of buffing to kill you! - Another case-per-case issue, but some of the bosses in this game give fake healthbars, some may not care as much but when I see a healthbar I like to assume that when it's empty, I'm done. Dark Souls 3 is another huge meanie about it but there is some bosses in this where I feel it takes the piss out of me.  Now despite these major annoyances, I do still recommend the game, my playthrough of what I did took a bit under 39 hours but it may vary, especially if you are newer to the genre, of if you're planning on doing more or less extra content than me. Personally this is an 8.5/10 game for me, with the rants above being my main explanations for what caused cuts in my enjoyment, the content locks being by far the biggest factor.",23,0.610842585563659668,76561198420200341,38.6,573

2024-09-27 12:27,88.9,不推荐,"The game has enough recommendations already so I choose to put this review on the not recommended section, click bait aside I do think that the game is over rated.  I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game.  The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map.  I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there arethousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side.  The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.  Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve.  You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers.  Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue.  Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues.  Overall it's a solid first AAA Chinese game but they need to improve their story telling for their next game.",29,0.601339161396026611,76561197973378280,88.9,241
2024-10-19 19:26,58.0,推荐,"I just finished the game and it's a solid 9/10! I had a great experience!  I never thought I would enjoy what seemed to be like a souls-like combatwise, but the game was much more than that. Rather than the sluggish, slow pace of souls-likes, Wukong is fast-paced, dynamic and fun from the go. As you advance, you get more tools in the form of spells, transformations, items, etc. to tackle the hardest of opponents. The gameplay is an immense joy from start to finish.  I had some issues following the story, as I know next to nothing about the legend of Sun Wukong. The game is an imagined sequal to Sun Wukongs legacy, so I would say knowing about it beforehand will elevate the story for you. That being said, the chapter stories are well told and executed and carried some emotional weight as well.   World and feeling is amazing. The game looks beautiful and it ran well on my four year old rig. I had to tune some settings, but the game ran at 80-100+ fps at all times - and looked stunning, even with some settings turned way down. A downside about the game world is first of all a lack of a map - there are so many areas, secret ones included (I managed to finish them all with A LOT of backtracking). The areas have lots of invisible walls and it's not always clear where you are ""allowed"" to go or not. Other games border the play area a lot better and more clearly.   The game (side content included) was just shy of 50 hours, which is absolutely worth the money imo. I've yet to go New Game+, but I know that it has more (new) items, spells, etc. and could be a fun romp.   I highly recommend this game :-)",29,0.600586831569671631,76561197970788678,58.0,0
2025-01-10 08:23,44.7,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong was one of the best games I played last year. Its presentation is incredibly impressive, everything from the combat, story, sound and visuals really stands out.  The gameplay is actually quite different to what is mainly presented online, the game is mainly portrayed as a souls like however other than some similarities in design it’s very much a unique action game with very tight combat, its pacing is more akin to Hack and Slash games such as Devil may cry. You play as Wukong, a very agile and powerful monkey that is on a journey. The story is definitely not an easy one to follow especially if you have no experience with its source material, “A journey to the West” the game is based on the classic novel and has tons of Chinese mythology which was incredibly unique and very different to recent action games the unique enemies, locations and interactions instantly made this game so interesting because it seemed all so different and unusual. The combat is very well made and all of the moment to moments action feels responsive and full of energy. The combat system is reliant on a few core features, the main being the skill tree where you will unlock new attacks, abilities, upgrades and extra bonuses. There is also unique armour and weapons that can craft along the way throughout your journey, the game offers you new armour quite frequently which was really great however it never really gives you the opportunity to mix and match armour since usually the newest thing you got was the strongest. The boss design overall was great, every large scale fight stood out and quite a few of them were very unforgettable. Just when you think you have seen all the game has to offer it suddenly introduces a new boss that's even crazier than the last. The pacing generally was really smooth and I only really got stuck a handful of times on a few bosses. Fortunately some extra xp/level grinding managed to get me through these encounters. The whole game itself is fairly confusing as you play through trying to grasp an idea of what's going on but that was part of the fun as you went from area to area discovering new locations as well as more friends and foes. One thing that I wasn't a huge fan of was the last section of the game, chapter 5. The whole chapter is set in this very large open area unlike any other part of the game, it felt a little rushed and the area felt very empty and lacking any true purpose other than to show off some new abilities. The actual boss fights however were great, but it just lacked in quality compared to the rest of the game. Fortunately you can find some good guides on the internet that will allow you to get through this area quicker.    The visual presentation is crazy, there are so many areas with drastically unique colour palettes and core themes. The characters, bosses, general enemies, armour and weapons all are crafted in extremely high detail. The environment art really stands out here, the lighting is always dramatic and the composition of many of the set pieces and main story sections were awesome to see. The slightly more linear design for the most part of the game really helped the artists design some really great locations, half of the fun was just seeing all of the new stuff as you play. The audio here is also just as great as the rest of the game, the sounds of your weapon clashing with foes sounds awesome and the atmospheric sounds really make the game feel alive as you wandered around in quiet forests and dark caves. The music for the most part takes a back seat in the game however when required the music really picks up with a very strong orchestral soundtrack which really adds to the action and excitement of the gameplay.   The performance is generally very strong, a couple of areas in the middle of the game there seemed to dip in performance a little but nothing that ruined the experience. Hopefully with some more patches/updates as time goes on these issues may become less apparent. The game will definitely require a higher end pc to play as the visual presentation is very graphically demanding. Fortunately the game offers quite a large amount of options to tune the game to your liking. As for bugs and issues I also had no serious problems, I did, however get stuck in a few spots. I don't think I was supposed to be a handful of times in the 5th chapter. Fortunately Wukong has quite a few options to get the player unstuck. Other than that I had no major problems.  In conclusion Black Myth: Wukong is definitely worth your time, it deserves all of the praise it's getting and I really hope that they consider a DLC or some form of a follow up to this game. It's going to be very hard to top what they have created, this game is one of the best things i've played in a while, it was well paced, full of surprises and challenged me just enough without being annoyingly tough.

First of all the graphics in this game are all fcked up , for example in bright daylight even a smallest shadow spots appears as pitch black. no matter how much you adjust your settings it doesnt help it one bit. Absolute tragedy of optimizing this game, one moment its at 60fps the next its at 30 for some reason.  And the biggest fault for me is the boss fights which are one of the worst i've ever seen in a soulslike game. The guy who did an interview for this game said ""This is not a soulslike experience"" or something in that effect , but the game wanting to appear souls like is its own downfall, they tried so hard to be like fromsoft its almost amusing. Artifically making the bosses hard in ways of adding cutscenes that do unavoidable damage to you, 2 or 3 minute sequences where bosses turn into stone and you cannot attack them , making a 3 minute fight  10 minutes long... Overall a very annoying and frustrating experience , i beat the game easily but i just feel like i've been scammed for those boss fights is just a joke , feels very cheap , feels like a very chinese dark souls...

There are certain areas in the game that really stand out, especially as you get towards the end game. You can see the effort put into the small details that really are meant to bring the word together in a fantastical way.   9/10 Design - The character designs are top notch. They really drive home the lore of the monkey king and utilize everything in their arsenal to bring the story to life. There are moments where it is dark and gritty and there are moments where it is bright and loud. You appreciate all of it  9/10 Story - How can you not enjoy the story of the journey to the west? The developers game science really did a exceptional job with teling the story while also providing engaging and challenging combat. The charatcers in-game all make you feel the story of the world is alive and the best part is the in-game anime/motion scenes that play inbetween chapters to really finalize what you experienced in the play before. They are not cheaply made either. Some of them i wish were full blown series. Fantastic job  8/10 Replayability - The game has an insane amount of hidden content and they offer all of this to you for one single price and no forced DLC purchases. There is alot of hidden bosses to find and little areas to explore. It is not quite open world, but it sure makes you feel that it somewhat is. The level design is top notch and allows for multiple playthroughs to explore every bit of it plus the skill trees and builds you can acquire to alter your playstyle are amazing as well.   9/10 Combat - The combat is incredible, fluid and VERY rewarding. Every hit feels powerful, has good sound to it and offers unique playstyles to keep you engaged.   10/10 Value - Black Myth Wukong offers UNBEATABLE value. The game is a one time purchase with no DLC and offers a massive amount of content to engage with. This is how games shoudl be made and offered with no microtransaction in sight at the time of this review.   Overall I would give this game a solid 9/10 for a score.

2024-11-11 14:51,61.2,不推荐,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.  BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES.  It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?  The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.  With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.  I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen). I'm sure most responses to this review will simply be: ""git gud""",58,0.602937936782836914,76561198096429390,61.2,0

What stood out to me the most were the boss battles. There are so many of them, and each one feels different and challenging in its own way. The variety of enemies is insane too. Just imagine: every creature has its own touching backstory in the game's bestiary!  You can definitely tell the developers were inspired by games like Dark Souls with the intense, thoughtful combat, and God of War for the sheer scale and epic feel of the action. But at the same time, Black Myth: Wukong feels totally fresh and unique because of its Chinese mythology and visual style. That blend of familiar and new kept me hooked the whole way through.   The only thing that felt far from perfect to me was the presence of incredibly large, empty areas in the third part of the game. They invite exploration, but there’s no reward for doing so, which is really disappointing for a detail-oriented player like me.  Last - but not the least - are six cartoons between each part of the game. Wow. They’re stunning - like mini-movies that not only look amazing but add so much to the story.

2024-10-25 18:23,232.8,推荐,"I am at the end of my 1st playthrough and I would like to recommend this game to anyone. I bought the game due to the hype, which of course was due to the release of the demo back in 2020 when there was a lockdown everywhere. The game looks ""open"" and the fight, the graphics was very very impressive from the demo. The game, was slightly disappointing at first as the game was pretty linear. I mean you can't get lost as the open world is not that open. Since I had spent over 3,300 hrs in Sekiro, I cannot help to find some similarity between the two games in terms of ""openness"". Also, some of the tasks or side quests involved back and forth among places. Without following playthrough videos, I am not sure if I can be where I am now in the game. True, I have made the decision to get 100% in my 1st playthrough so I followed playthrough videos. I was going to moan about it until I arrived at the final chapter. It is hugh and there is no hint whatsoever where and what to do next, especially now I can ""fly""!!! I have to give marks to those videos makers for their time to find things out otherwise I almost certainly will be lost and frustrated. Thinking about it, I suppose that this is their design strategy for ""longivity"", if not for the playthrough videos. Saying that, I have also found out that bosses have different moves in new game plus. And of course, one has to play NG+ because of achievements. Like Sekiro, certain resources are restricted, i.e. they cannot be farmed. Oh, just one important information for all interested new players, the Dev. has nerfed the drop rate of some important resources, not only that, they has added a condition that I personally have not come across in other game, which is that the longer if you stay in a location (due to farming), the drop rate which is already low, will drop even lower. I remembered before the last patch, I got so many precious resources without even trying to farm them. Now, I only got 1 out of 10 runs. Don't get me wrong, you can still farm but you will have to be really really patience. Like any other RPG games, one has to upgrade weapons, armours, items, to get stronger, more powerful. There are quite a few weapons but the Dev. has spent a lot of effort balancing them out. So, you gain some but you will lose some. But this is good, As the players will have to think how to build their Wukong. Oh, yeah, just a warning, you cannot change anything during a combat. Everything has to be set up prior to starting a fight. So, you will have to learn the enemies' moves and ability and then set up your Wukong accordingly. I guess that this is the fun and challenging part (on top of the fight). Similar to Sekiro, in order to play this game effectively and smoothly, you really have to do a lot of tinkering with your graphic settings. DO NOT assume that you have, say, a RTX4090, you can just go into the game at the highest settings and play smoothly. There are a lot of complaints blaming the game by people with RTX 40 series GPU. But using simple logic, I reckon that it is a combination of hardware and software. I have a laptop with RTX 3080 and Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU with 16 Gb RAM. So it is not top notch. But I spent about a couple of days researching and then tinkering, I can play the game smoothly, no problem at 74 FPS at 1K and 65 FPS at 2K (using my brother-in-law's 2K monitor at his home). Sorry, I digressed. Without giving away too much, the combat mechanics of the game can be clunky in certain area but mostly smooth. I guess this may be me not getting used to all the different fighting styles as I am more concentrated on getting all the achievements. So, my advice is to spend a lot of time on each fighting style. By the way, unlike the set up, you can change fighting style on the go. So, if you get experienced in all the different styles, the combat can be pretty impressive. Since I am a diehard fan of Sekiro (maybe Ghost of Tsuhima as well, soon), I cannot help to compare the three in terms of combat and the way players can progress in the game. In Sekiro, one is forced to ""gitgud"" in order to progress (as one has to defeat boss to get past and move on). Tsuhima, the progress of players' ability seems to be easier and more organised. And for Black Myth Wukong, hehe, there is XP farming. I mean I was already level 120 something half way through the game. So, I got through some bosses, not by skills but vitality, i.e. get hurt less. In Sekiro, farming XP only get you skills, not strength nor health so you still have to ""gitgud"". Tsuhima, there is not much farming as most enemies don't respawn after killing them. But upgrading skills can be really powerful, especially the stealth ones. Don't get me wrong. You still have to learn the enemies' moves in Black Myth: Wukong so you can learn the timing when to dodge and when to attack. You can't just go barging in. By the way, stealth is not an option in Black Myth: Wukong. You really have to learn to chain your moves in between dodging and healing in Wukong. Now the story, I thought that this game was loosely based on the infamous ""Journey to the West"" but in fact, it is more based on the book called ""Wukong Zhuan"" (loosely translate to biography of Wukong). Journey to the West was translated to English a few decades ago, but there is no English translation for ""Wukong Zhuan"". I only learnt of this a couple of days ago from a Youtube video posted by a Chinese looking lady from Canada. The video was actually about the explanation of the bad endings of this game. So, if you are interested, you can search for it in Youtube. And yes, in my opinion, according to her explanation and conclusions from ""Wukong Zhuan"", it is pretty ""dark"". I guess that is why the game is called ""Black Myth: Wukong"". Apparently, all the hints are actually in the game, from the conversations, mumblings of various NPC. I didn't take notice of most of it so I didn't know or rather what the story is trying to say. From the game, I only have the impression that Game Science have created a game telling how Wukong can be ""alive"" again. There no strong or obvious hints from objects within the game suggesting what was going on. It was all done by the mumblings and conversations in weird high pitch (which is a turn off for me). So, in my opinion, the story of the game is weak but the game itself is very strong and quite entertaining. I mean I will definitely get into NG+, NG++ and so on.",2,0.5461578369140625,76561197966076282,698.5,214

The developers finally listened to the players and added a map feature which helps with some aspects, but navigation can still be unsatisfying giving how it is entirely arbitrary where you can and cannot go.  The map/game open up considerably after the first chapter which is very much on rails, but the game never provides true freedom of exploration which is a shame.   There are a handful of severe difficulty spikes and areas/bosses that are simply no fun to get through.  The game is often incredible--the cinematic presentation when encountering a new boss or miniboss and simply taking in the stunning vistas keeps you coming back, but the core gameplay is for the most part just adequate. I initially wrote my negative review while struggling through a particularly un-fun section in Chapter 3 (and no, saying that the level is meant to be a vision of hell so it not being fun to play is intentional is asinine).  While the game might not exactly be ""all style and no substance,"" it definitely leans heavily to the 'style' side.  Even though I've come back to the game after bouncing off, I'm keeping my review at negative because I feel the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews is misleading, given how a bit too often the game feels like a chore that you have to get through to see the next cool thing.",9,0.542583703994750977,76561198128446233,40.1,0
2024-10-04 09:34,111.7,不推荐,"[h1]Gameplay[/h1] In short, it's a [b]boss rush soulslike game.[/b] The game features 100 bosses, 90 of which are unique with different patterns and designs, and it's awesome. However, as I mentioned, this is primarily a boss rush game. You defeat a boss, fight some regular mobs, and then encounter another boss. Other than that, there are a few NPC questlines, but they're similar to what you'd find in [i]Elden Ring[/i]: you talk to a statue, then talk to the NPC again, and that's it. At least, unlike [i]Elden Ring[/i], some of these quests include cool cutscenes and boss fights, which is a nice touch.  [h1]Open World[/h1] The game is divided into six chapters, and each chapter has its own area. However, except for one, the other five chapters are essentially [b]massive, beautiful corridors.[/b] While this is disappointing, it's not terrible once you get over it.  At least every chapter has its own unique theme—like exploring a lush, green forest in one chapter or venturing into a spider's cave in another.  The only major issue is the [b]secrets.[/b] I’m sorry, but I can’t tell if I’m stupid or if the design is genuinely bad. Locking some of the best boss fights behind secrets is frustrating, and to make it worse, these secrets aren’t even fun to find.  [h1]Story[/h1] So, the main plot revolves around the Heaven Order defeating Wukong and cutting him into six pieces. You play as a common monkey, searching for his relics in each chapter. I haven’t read [i]Journey to the West[/i], and I’m not Chinese, so I can’t say whether they did a good or bad job with the story.  However, one thing I can complain about is that our protagonist [u]doesn’t talk.[/u] It’s stupid. He doesn’t even have facial expressions—it’s like [i]Max Payne 1[/i] where they just slapped a PNG onto the face. I really hope that in a future DLC, they give him a voice or at least some kind of personality.  [h1]Graphics[/h1] The visuals are stunning—beautiful effects, incredible textures, and overall breathtaking design. BUT, [i]unless you play in 4K,[/i] the game looks like a blurry, pixelated, ghosting mess. I don’t care if it’s a great triple-A game; the optimization is terrible. While it’s not as bad as [i]The Last of Us Part 1,[/i] it’s still frustrating.  If you want stable FPS, you [b]MUST[/b] enable frame generation—it’s not an option. Unless you own a very high-end PC, you’re stuck using DLSS or FSR with an average scaling of 50-70%. That’s disgraceful.  Let me clarify: I have a [u]4080 Super and a 7800X3D[/u]—my rig is high-end. So, I’m sorry, but what the hell is going on with gamers? How can they accept such garbage optimization? Yes, this is an [b]AWESOME[/b] game, but if you can’t play it properly, what’s the point? If developers don’t want to optimize their games and force players to play at 50% resolution scaling, why even bother using Unreal Engine 5?  [h1]Do I Recommend? No. Why?[/h1] I’m sorry, but I can’t recommend this game with its current optimization. In recent years, game developers have [b]consistently released poorly optimized[/b] games and gotten away with it. I don’t understand why gamers don’t complain about this. Why do they lick the boots of these companies? You are the [b]consumer.[/b] They need to sell you a good game and make you happy with a quality product.  But instead, players bow down and waste their energy complaining about irrelevant things like “wokeness” or “SJWs.” I’m not American, but all I can say is this: FK your SJWs. FK your woke agenda. F*K YOU, you braind** mo*****rs. [b]Open your eyes.[/b]  These companies use the whole “woke” controversy to [b]distract you[/b], so you don’t see the real issue: they’re taking shortcuts and delivering broken, subpar products. Stop falling for it. [b]Focus on the real problems.[/b]",3,0.541666686534881592,76561198108143087,134.2,0

Roughly 30 minutes in and its the same thing as chapter 1 with the some new scenery.   Combat is mid. Its flashy but uses the same move sets over and over. Skill upgrades are not really cool or fun, and once you master dodge they are useless. Dodge-hit-dodge-hit for about 15-20 minutes so you can run through an area where you  can just hit everything, and fight another boss.   The devs nerf the player and buff the bosses. Its like your hits do nothing at all. You will become more powerful as you level up various skills, but the boss will always be so much more than you will ever be...unless you can dodge, then its just a test of your patience.   I enjoy the game for what it is, but ill likely never beat it nor play for more than an hour at a time going forward.   The intro of the game before you're free to explore is about 2 hours, so make sure you really want this game because you will likely not be able to get a refund.",8,0.538922131061553955,76561199521472342,4.2,0

2025-01-27 18:00,55.2,推荐,"Probably one of the best games I have played in my life, hands down GOTY. I don't even know from where to  begin with, the story, the depth, the overall design of the world, enemies as well as characters?! Everything is top notch.  So basically, Black Myth Wukong is a souls-like boss rush game. At first I was kinda let down that this isn't a normal game, or even a normal souls-like. I felt like my ""stamina"" would drain after encountering so many bosses that need a lot of focus to beat. But oh boy was I mistaken? I never put the controller down due to tiresome, I was always coming back until I beat that freaking blue huge headed dude. The reason for that is creativity, and fair challenge. It never felt unfair to fight an enemy, no matter how much stronger he was. The world building and storytelling, along with some of the best and most interesting boss designs in gaming ever will make you to never want to quit. The game is linear with a lot of secrets to uncover per map, it never feels limited or empty, a new challenge always awaits in every corner. Developers seemed to know and understand what players truly want, this becomes even more apparent on the final battle of the true ending. There isn't a simple way to explain Wukong, the game has incredible depth in every aspect, that it would took me a lot of time to go into detail for each one of them, so just like I do with all my recent reviews, I will start pointing the pros and cons of it, to keep the review as readable as it can be.  [h2] PROS [/h2]  -Gameplay: Typical Souls-Like with a lot of spells and combos. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Enemy Design: There are like 100 different bosses I believe? along with another hundreds of normal enemies. All of them have out of this world design both mechanic and aesthetic wise. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Character Design: Well, monke, pig and other Chinese mythology characters, you can't go wrong. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Graphics: Breathtaking [u] 9/10 [/u] -World Design: Every map/world has its own theme, feels like different biomes (snow, desert, underground etc) [u] 9/10 [/u] -Story: Starts slow, ends in epicness, the more you play the more you get hooked in. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Audio/Sound Design: [u] Top notch/10 [/u] -Soundtrack: [u] Epic/10 [/u] -100% Achievement Difficulty: Easy [u] (10/10 [/u] -Game Length: Reflects its price [u] 10/10 [/u]  [h2] CONS [/h2] -Weird hitboxes in certain fights: Scropionlord is a nightmare due to broken hitboxes. -A lot of invisible walls in places they didn't need to be. I get it for nonreachable areas, but when they are in legit paths is just lazy, you could simply fill the room with loot instead, or enemies.  [u] Conclusion: [/u] One of the best and most enjoyable experiences a person can have in gaming, before I beat the final boss I was thinking how to write the review, so many words in my head, but I am just kinda speechless, the only thing I can say is this..

2024-10-01 05:38,118.4,推荐,"This game is great and worth getting even at full price but it isn't the 10/10 some people are making it out to be. It does some things great like the number of bosses and the variety in their attack styles but other things like the story and polish it falls short on.   [h3][b][u] Audio: 9/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  I played with the English voices and they sounded great, some of them have a British accent but it wasn't bad and I think the voices fit. The game has great surround sound and music. I have heard for the Chinese players there is music from a popular TV series from the 80s about the Journey to the West that a lot of them grew up on so that is a nice touch for them.   [h3][b][u] Graphics: 8.5/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  I have a 7900XT and played at 4K 60FPS. The game does look great when you stop to take in the surroundings but the game forces you to use upscaling which is a negative to me. I don't have DLSS so I am not sure how it looks in this game but having tested the other 3 available upscalers (FSR, TSR, XESS) they all have some drawbacks and are not as good as native. Setting the upscaler to 100 does not seem to set it to native. In the Benchmark tool they released before the full game it showed even at 100 there was different results between the 3 upscalers and in the full game if you turn on motion blur to strong and spin around you can still see ghosting around his head so the upscaling is still on. I am also pretty sure this is not FSR 3.1 which has the new upscaler so I would like to see that added at some point. Turning on Frame Gen with both FSR and TSR causes trees in some locations to constantly flicker when moving. I was able to hide this by turning motion blur on but I normally do not play with motion blur so that is kind of annoying but to minimize the visual issues upscaling causes it is needed in this game.   I eventually settled on leaving FSR to 50 with the Very High graphics preset to get a near constant 60FPS. Without the flickering from Frame Gen I only had to deal with the ghosting from upscaling but with motion blur set to weak I was able to hide it enough that It didn't bother me for the rest of the game. Outside of the upscaling issue the game looks amazing.  [h3][b][u] Story: 7/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  There are some translation errors but they have been fixing them overtime. The story however is the biggest issue I had with the game. It takes place after the Journey to the West so before buying the game I watched a several videos on the Journey to the West to have a frame of reference in the game. But even with that the story is presented in a way that you will probably be confused if you have not actually read the novel. A lot of the details that elevate a story to being great will be missed so you will need to find an explanation from someone online who has read the novel to fully appreciate the story. The game is definitely made with the expectation you know the Journey to the West novel well. The game does try to add some back story on characters through journal entries you get from beating enemies but I would say the majority of them were just random tales or poetry that while interesting were not relevant to the main story. Some definitely did explain more about the major characters and the story but those were still not enough in my opinion.   After you beat a chapter you unlock a mural of events relevant to that chapter. If you zoom in you will find the option to click on parts of it and a narrator will give some brief dialogue that does help but if you don't zoom it's easy to skip past it and never get the dialogue. The dialogue there is usually helpful but they are brief and leave you wanting more. With all the effort they put into the mostly irrelevant journal entries I think it would have been better to reduce the journal entries and instead have a small detailed recap of the parts of the Journey to the West that chapter is based on before or after a chapter.   There are 6 chapters in total and after each chapter there is a cool animated video but they have little dialogue and the stories can seem out of place. Sometimes the story is in reference to the main story of the chapter you just finished so you understand what it's about but other times it's about a side story in the upcoming chapter so you have no idea what it was about. If you read the novel though you will recognize the character and have an idea of what is coming up. It's possible in the one where it references a side story for you to miss it in the chapter and then be even more confused about what the previous video was about since the character never appeared. In other cases the video references something that happened in the previous chapter but the characters are in another form so you have no idea who it is unless you read the novel and make the connection.  It's a shame because there is a really good story here with great characters and acting but it feels like a lot of the time the characters aren't given enough time to have the impact they could have because the story is told with the expectation of you knowing the backstory already. Now all that said if you don't mind having to go read a bunch of forum posts or read the book the story in the game is actually pretty interesting and the secret/true ending hints at what the DLC should be about.  [h3][b][u] Game Play: 7.5/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  I have seen some people say it's too hard and others it's too easy. I would say the difficulty is closer to God of War and  the Souls games are harder. The game does a great job of making it feel like an actual journey though. You start off weak and the game makes you learn the mechanics early on or you won't be able to beat the boss. As I gained new abilities the following chapters felt easier overall. I had the most deaths in Chapter 1 as I was learning but after that the number of tries I needed to beat a boss dropped significantly. In the later chapters they raise the difficulty again so it doesn't get too easy. NG+ is done really well too because the best items are only in NG+ so there is an actual reason to do NG+ and it's satisfying to destroy early bosses.  There are over 100 bosses and most have different fighting styles and don't use unfair moves that insta kill. The combat is fun and can be mixed up as you get multiple spells, transformations, staff stances, and weapons. But there are some bugs and things the game does not explain. Sometimes your character just won't dodge or use an item in the middle of a fight. Sometimes this is due to status effects like being shocked but the game never explains the effects of these statuses so a lot of people think the combat is laggy. Other times it is due to input lag or a bug. I have tested it out with my controller and seen outside of fights there is sometimes noticeable input lag. I was able to fix it by restarting the game but if it starts in the middle of a fight you are stuck with it as changing the controller didn't help.   Level design is mostly linear but I like it because it's more curated so you get a better experience. Even though it is linear there is still a lot to explore. I never had an issue with the invisible walls like some of these people claim. It never broke the atmosphere for me and 99% of the time I could tell where a wall was. The worst area for me was the open world chapter because it is mostly empty so I had to waste time exploring a boring area. There is a snow chapter that is semi open world and it was the second worst area because it was a pain to explore. That chapter is also the one most people have performance issues on due to size and snow. Outside of 1 area the environment is not an obstacle like in Souls games but the camera can mess you up sometimes.   Even with those issues it's still a great game that I recommend and I can't wait for the DLC.

When I started it was actually pretty cool, the cut scenes were sick and the story was intriguing. However after only two hours of playing the game I instantly got bored of repeatedly just pressing x and going to boss fight after boss fight. The skill tree was terrible and the game wouldn't even give you upgraded gear to fight new bosses or a weapon as the stick is the only weapon you get in the game. For me personally I think fighting a boss should be more of a special occurrence and not something to be fighting every ten minutes like it is in this game. The combat system was also very rigid and the hit boxes were terrible, I would be there just spamming the button to dodge and it would only work 50% of the time. Also the heavy attacks are so poorly optimized with the combat system which led me to use light attacks on bosses who were barely affected.

I was NOT expecting to be this impressed, but wow; After finishing the story and seeing almost all the side content this game has to offer, I am beyond surprised.  The graphics are insanely good, the soundtrack is beautiful, the gameplay has some of the most responsive movement & melee I've experienced, and the art direction is just incomparable! It's really hard to find anything to complain about in this game. You can feel the passion the devs put into every square inch of this game's world. Like seriously, there are so many QOL features that only someone who was experiencing the game as a player would think to add!  Admittedly I know absolutely nothing about Journey to The West, and I really struggled to understand the story and references as a result, but I really enjoyed going in blind and trying to piece it together for myself. The character and enemy bios in the Journal are just SO GOOD too, if you're into that kind of stuff.  I cannot recommend Black Myth Wukong enough to anyone who enjoys a decent challenge and engaging mechanics. Game Science has set a high bar with this being their first game, and I will eagerly await their next release.  10 Bananas/10 Bananas",1,0.52702707052230835,76561197971479068,56.1,0

2024-09-25 12:01,152.8,推荐,"Really interesting to see Chinese mythology portrayed like this in a video game. Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air.   The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).  The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.  Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end).   Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.  8.5/10",1,0.525862038135528564,76561198151665307,152.8,0

2025-03-21 21:24,53.5,推荐,"The GOAT of Action RPGs – Black Myth: Wukong  As someone who has watched Journey to the West countless times and read the novel from cover to cover, I can confidently say Black Myth: Wukong is the best adaptation of the legendary tale I’ve ever seen. This game beautifully blends the mythological world of Sun Wukong with modern action RPG gameplay, and it’s a masterpiece in almost every sense.  Story The narrative is one of the game's standout features. Drawing deep inspiration from Journey to the West, Black Myth: Wukong manages to keep the essence of the ancient legend while making it accessible and thrilling for modern audiences. The story feels grounded, emotional, and, at times, profoundly philosophical, delving into themes of rebellion, enlightenment, and destiny. Sun Wukong's journey—his rise to power, his fall from grace, and his quest for redemption—is masterfully captured, and you genuinely feel the weight of his character arc.  Graphics Visually, this game is a showstopper. From the lush forests and vast landscapes to the awe-inspiring bosses and magical creatures, the art direction is nothing short of breathtaking. The level of detail in every scene, from the fluidity of combat animations to the epic scale of the environments, is staggering. Each new area feels like a new world to explore, each more beautiful and intricate than the last. If you enjoy games that offer a rich, immersive world to lose yourself in, Black Myth: Wukong will definitely satisfy your hunger for visual grandeur.  Chinese Dub For me, the cherry on top is the Chinese dub. The voice acting feels so authentic, bringing an added layer of immersion to the game. Wukong’s voice actor captures the mischievous and rebellious spirit of the Monkey King perfectly. There’s something deeply satisfying about hearing the dialogues in the original language, which truly enhances the experience of being transported into ancient China. It’s a treat for anyone who appreciates the cultural authenticity of the story.  Music The soundtrack is phenomenal. From sweeping orchestral pieces during epic battles to more serene and contemplative tracks that accompany moments of reflection, the music matches the mood perfectly. The score beautifully blends traditional Chinese instruments with modern orchestral arrangements, creating a soundscape that feels both timeless and grand. It adds emotional depth to the narrative and enhances the overall atmosphere of the game.  Dismiss the Naysayers Now, to address a small but vocal group of people who seem hell-bent on tearing this game down because it’s not ""woke"" enough—honestly, it's disappointing. Black Myth: Wukong is a game deeply rooted in Chinese mythology and culture, and the developers have stayed true to that vision. If you’re coming into the game expecting some forced, politically correct take on an ancient legend, this isn’t the game for you. The Monkey King’s story isn’t about pandering to modern sensibilities; it’s about growth, power, rebellion, and wisdom in a world full of danger and mysticism. Let the game be what it is, and don’t drag it down with misguided critiques. This game deserves to be celebrated for what it brings to the table: a stunning reimagining of a beloved myth, an engaging story, and a thrilling action RPG experience.  Final Thoughts Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just a game; it’s an experience—a celebration of Chinese mythology, culture, and storytelling. Whether you're a fan of Journey to the West or just someone who loves a great action RPG, this game should be on your radar. Stunning visuals, a gripping story, excellent voice work, and an incredible soundtrack combine to make Black Myth: Wukong a true standout in the genre. It’s a must-play.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198090409385,53.5,0

2025-03-12 18:34,37.0,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong is a cinematic masterpiece. This game has everything that I want gameplay-wise on a souls-like game, without being a ""true"" souls-like, because tbh its more similar to God of War PS4 all things considered. But anyway, if you're looking for a good story-rich game with fun gameplay BM:W will not disappoint. My only gripe with the game is that I feel the difficulty is kinda too easy, and some levels are very annoying to traverse, but its not enough to bring the game down. I'll breakdown my thoughts more down below, but TLDR:  10/10 peak game, a perfect experience overall, would smash yaoguais with my stick again.  Story & Worldbuilding: 10/10 I've never really had any interest in Chinese myth before, but after playing this game I literally read the entire original Journey to the West novel just so I can ""get"" the references in the game. The game's story and world feels like a love letter, a celebration of all aspect of Chinese mythology both ancient and new interpretations mixed with truly phenomenal original writing from the devs. I really like how the story feels like it keeps escalating again and again until Wukong- welp it's gonna be a huge spoiler if I continue, so just experience it for yourself. I guarantee, no matter how high your expectation is, its still going to blow your mind all the same.  Gameplay: 10/10 Gameplay is solid... nah who am I kidding, its perfect. We have the usual stuff like dodge roll, camera lock on, light and heavy attacks, jumps, etc., alongside fresh new take on the skill tree system. You can re-spec your skills at any point in the game which is HUGE for build variety and replayabillity. And speaking of build variety, there are a plethora of builds you can try with 3 distinctly different stances: Smash, Pillar, and Thrust.  We also have several spells that are unique and build-defining, alongside an enormous library of transformations to chose from. Also all the armor sets have set bonuses like in Monster Hunter, and all of them, yes ALL of them, enables completely unique builds. Its just a shame that some builds are CLEARLY way better than others though, so there's not really much reason to play them aside for wanting to challenge yourself. Now with all these combinations of spells and equipments, you can definitely live out your fantasy of become lore accurate Sun Wukong. Its just a bit of a shame that the bosses are quite easy, they won't really halt your progress for longer than 30-60 minutes at best until you learn how to beat them. But don't be mistaken, some particularly special bosses are still sufficiently difficult, warranting you to ""get good"" in order to beat them but they are way too few and far between. But I guess that's not really a problem because the lore for the bosses are pretty good and that fact carried the experience for me.   Sound & Music: 10/10 Its peak. It goes insanely hard almost every single time I don't know how they keep doing it. Sounds design was on point as well, I particularly really like the sound that The Destined One's staff makes when bonking people around and the sound of perfect dodges, like fr its super satisfying.   Environment & Level Design: 8/10 Oh it takes a LOT to render the environment alright, and was it worth it? yeah 100%. The game looks BEAUTIFUL. Every level are so artisticly crafted, every monument treated with immense detail and care, and everything is just so beautifully sculptured, like literally every corner you turn to, it looks good. BUT the level design? nahhhh I see what the level designers are trying to do but they're not cooking for real. I get that they're going for the ""larger than life"" type of feel but man some of these areas are just way too empty, and some areas are too annoying to traverse through because 1. The layout is just not that good, and the map is confusing at times and 2. Sometimes its kinda unclear where they want you to go. But most levels are good and also they got the whole ""connected area"" thing with shortcuts and unlockables which I really dig it so its still pretty good all things considered.  Aight thats it, I dont want the review to be too long, just wanna share my thoughts after completing the game for the first time.

2025-02-22 06:00,56.8,推荐,"[h1]Black Myth: Wukong — A Revolutionary Ode to Eastern Mythology [/h1]  [h2] Introduction[/h2] In an era where gaming constantly pushes boundaries of storytelling and technology, Black Myth: Wukong emerges as a thunderous declaration of China's cultural renaissance in the digital age. Developed by Game Science, this action RPG reimagines the legendary Journey to the West with breathtaking ambition, blending mythic grandeur with cutting-edge artistry. It is not merely a game—it is a pilgrimage through a world where every frame whispers ancient secrets, and every battle roars with the spirit of rebellion.  [h3]1. A Visual Masterpiece Rooted in Tradition [/h3] Black Myth: Wukong stuns with its painterly landscapes, where mist-shrouded mountains and crumbling temples evoke classical Chinese ink-wash paintings brought to life. Using Unreal Engine 5, the game transforms folklore into visceral reality: fur on the Monkey King’s armor sways with uncanny realism; rain slicks the scales of towering dragon bosses; and crumbling statues of forgotten gods seem to bleed centuries of sorrow. This is not just graphical prowess—it’s a love letter to China’s artistic heritage, proving that ""next-gen"" can coexist with timeless aesthetics.  [h3]2. Combat: Poetry in Motion [/h3] The game’s combat system dances between brutality and grace. Wukong’s staff strikes carry the weight of a thousand grudges, yet flow like calligraphy strokes—each dodge, parry, and transformation (into cicadas, giant apes, or spectral forms) feels like unlocking verses from an ancient martial arts manual. Boss battles ascend to operatic heights: imagine dueling a four-faced Buddhist colossus amid falling cherry blossoms, or outwitting a shapeshifting fox spirit whose laughter echoes through a moonlit graveyard. Unlike many soulslikes, Wukong rewards cunning as much as reflexes, weaving Taoist philosophy into its gameplay DNA.  [h3]3. Subverting Expectations, Honoring Legacy [/h3] While drawing from Wu Cheng’en’s 16th-century epic, Black Myth boldly reinterprets its characters. This Sun Wukong is no mere trickster—he’s a weary warrior haunted by celestial betrayals. Side characters like the Pig Demon and Spider Queen receive Shakespearean depth, their tragedies mirroring themes of karma and redemption. Environmental storytelling thrives: a shattered prayer bell might hint at a god’s fall from grace; bloodstained scrolls recount battles lost to time. This isn’t cultural appropriation—it’s cultural resurrection.  [h3]4. Soundscape: Where Myth Meets Metal [/h3] The soundtrack merges guqin melodies with thunderous percussion, while voice acting (in classical Chinese dialects) lends gravitas to every deity and demon. Combat sounds are visceral—the crack of a staff breaking armor, the otherworldly shrieks of underworld creatures—yet never drown out subtle details: the rustle of bamboo forests, the chime of distant temple bells. It’s an acoustic tapestry that bridges past and present.  [h3]5. A Watershed Moment for Global Gaming [/h3] Beyond its technical triumphs, Black Myth: Wukong challenges the West-centric gaming narrative. Its success proves that stories rooted in non-Western mythologies can resonate globally when told with authenticity and audacity. Early sales smashing records worldwide (including 10 million copies in 3 days) aren’t just numbers—they’re a roar from audiences hungry for new perspectives. As the gaming industry grapples with homogenization, this title stands as a beacon: true innovation often lies in rediscovering what others have forgotten.  [h2] Conclusion[/h2] Black Myth: Wukong is more than a game—it’s a cultural exorcism. It confronts the ghosts of colonial-era erasure, wielding Sun Wukong’s staff not just as a weapon, but as a brush painting China’s myths onto the global consciousness. For players, it offers an unforgettable journey; for developers, a masterclass in balancing tradition with innovation. As the credits roll, one truth becomes clear: the Monkey King has finally broken free from the pages of history—and the gaming world will never be the same.",2,0.523809552192687988,76561198835452838,56.8,0

Just started playing the game for 3 days since I upgraded my PC solely and purely to be able to play this game and man This game does not disappoint me at all. Being an asian and grew up watching journey to the west original series 2 episodes per week from the local channel since it was the only form of entertainment back then with sanction, dictations and stuff. No video player nor any player of any kind the only thing I had growing up for entertainment was one television set every 20 household have to go to the neighbour house with the whole family just to watch that show every week. Not every people are allowed  to buy it either lol. Anyway thats how much this game gave me nostalgia. That show took over 10 years for me to finish from my age 8 - 18. So literally a third of my life grew up watching that one and only show. I was too afraid that this game would disappoint me but no . This game is literally worthy of every praise it got. It literally depicted most of the lore more or less accurate or within relatable nature. This game lore is chronologically after the journey to the west 2 if you guys know it. Yes there was the script for journey to the west 2 after the first journey to the west. but for some reason it was not globally renounced or something I dunno. I had watched a couple of episodes from jtw 2 here and there while I was travelling to china back in 2003 for a month from my hotel channel. But I dunno why it was not globally popular or something. But anyway this game will not disappoint you in anyway at all. Take it from long time fans of JTW since its humble beginning like 28 years ago.  The gameplay wise perfect. The graphic man it would be really great if my rig can utilize it to the fullest with RTacing and such to the fullest. But sadly cant. But still it looks stunning. The lorewise man, it makes sense and relatable not totally strayed apart from the original story and such. One reminder this game is not JTW ok. This game is the showcase of a new aspect of timeline and storytelling after the JTW and JTW2 focusing mainly on SWk related stuff.   This game is a must have.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198167263901,54.1,0

2025-01-11 01:51,51.5,推荐,"Upon review of this game before playing it I noticed a mixed bag of 'Soulslike' comments. I can attest that it did indeed have those elements.  A more linear play style with a good chunk of boss rushing between 5 Chapters. As you get through the first couple chapters into the belly of the game it really opens up.  For some that's a deal breaker, for me it's a nice reward of exploration after back-to-back boss encounters.  The minimal HUD is a nice touch, along with very smooth fighting styles.  It allows you to really take in the stunning landscapes without too much clutter, big fan.   As someone who's mainly playing open world RPG's, this was a frustrating, yet rewarding grind. Contrary to some folks opinions, I quite enjoyed the story line as I progressed. The elements of companions and NPC's gave it a lot more life than a 'Soulslike', which I appreciated.   The last boss may of taken me 32 tries to beat, but if I can do it anyone can.  8/10",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199708033153,51.5,0

2024-11-30 00:17,108.2,推荐,"First Impressions of Black Myth: Wukong  When you first step into the world of Black Myth: Wukong, it's hard not to be swept away by its sheer ambition and artistry. Developed by Game Science, this action RPG is a jaw-dropping blend of Chinese mythology, intricate storytelling, and cutting-edge graphics that immediately sets a high bar for the industry.  The visuals are, quite simply, breathtaking. From the meticulously designed environments to the lifelike animations of Wukong and his adversaries, every frame feels like a piece of art. The Unreal Engine work here shines, with stunning particle effects, realistic lighting, and attention to detail that immerse you in the mystical land of Journey to the West.  Combat is another standout. It’s fast, fluid, and immensely satisfying, combining traditional hack-and-slash mechanics with Wukong's shapeshifting abilities. Whether you’re fighting hordes of enemies or squaring off against massive, screen-filling bosses, every encounter feels unique and challenging. The game doesn’t shy away from difficulty, but it's the kind that pushes you to strategize rather than frustrate.  What truly sets Black Myth: Wukong apart, though, is its commitment to its cultural roots. The game draws heavily from Chinese folklore, presenting it with a reverence and depth that feels both fresh and authentic. The lore is rich, and even the smallest details — like the design of NPCs or the inclusion of traditional music — reflect a labor of love.  While this is just an early impression, Black Myth: Wukong already feels like a masterpiece in the making. It promises not only to be a major step forward for the gaming industry but also a beacon of how storytelling, art, and gameplay can come together to create something truly extraordinary. If the final product delivers on this potential, we’re looking at a genre-defining experience.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198941314196,116.7,66

A few frustrating design decisions here and there, like not being able to complete the purple talisman quest if you defeated the boss first, same with Daoist Mi. Some bosses felt a bit gimmick-y, and don't even get me started on Hundred-eyed Daoist Master and his lock-on + hitbox combo.  Other than that, there are lots of surprises and fun innovations throughout the game, which keeps it interesting and prevents it from becoming repetitive.  Overall I found the game to be easier than FromSoftware games (which are my closest comparisons to this game). In my opinion, the fact that you can defeat many bosses on your first try makes them more forgettable and fails to give you the usual feeling of accomplishment compared to a more difficult boss.  However, these minor setbacks in combat design and difficulty were made up for the absolutely astonishing experience that the game delivered through the storytelling, visuals, cutscenes, art direction, and just a general feeling of grandeur and epicness throughout its duration. This is the best non-FromSoftware souls-like game I have played.

The only thing I'd complain about is the lack of any sort of mapping, but I completely understand how that would be detrimental to the exploration aspect of the game. It makes sense to not have one because learning the terrain and exploring to find out if you missed anything is a much better experience over glancing at a map and mindlessly beelining for the checkpoint marker.  The bosses and NPCs are all unique and that honestly blows my mind considering how many of them there are in this game. I love the way the different animals actually act like they're that animal and aren't just human personalities wrapped in an animal shell. The wolves growl and bark, the rats snarl and sniffle, the foxes yip and chitter, the monkeys yap and spin, the felines roar and display their impressive agility despite their enormous sizes, the boars try to flip enemies with their snouts, the frogs use their legs and tongues to their advantage, the cobras hiss and spit, etc. It really feels like you're interacting with the animal and all of its unique characteristics and traits and not just, again, a sowrdsman in the body of an animal that has nothing in terms of mechanics or behaviors to show for it. Even the different types of avians and dragons behave like their species and act accordingly. The studio really did do a great job with this game.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198073600299,123.3,163

The end of it gets pretty tough against the last boss and the the secret boss that unlocks the alternate ending, but never unfair and just a case of learning the move sets - even if it took me ~40 attempts to beat the secret end boss!  Overall, I thoroughly recommend and is definitely my GotY for 2024.  P.S I've seen comments saying it's on a par with difficulty with God of War. In my opinion as someone who has now 100% competed both GoW games and Wukong, Wukong is a lot harder, but I had a lot more fun.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198223983264,127.7,307

Combat is cleverly designed and, although your own move set is limited, the enemies always bring unexpected tricks and evolutions - it is very balanced. Despite having a few issues rending shadows and light particles during long cutscenes, graphics are brilliant and everything runs smooth. Designers were creative, the Chinese mythology is super interesting, and I didn't mind the grind to scale or endless attempts to best difficult enemies one bit if it meant progressing to see what the next chapter has in store. Lastly, and most importantly, this game continued to surprise me with larger areas to explore and cool new features the deeper I went which kept me entertained for at least 60 hours and is a testament to how well crafted and balanced the game is.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198079665881,99.0,0

2024-10-22 13:00,109.9,推荐,"For me, two things make me fall in love with a game: a great story and fun gameplay that lets me escape reality. Black Myth: Wukong excels in both. Based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, the story is incredibly engaging, with stunning animations and well-designed characters that pull you deeper into the narrative.  Created in Unreal Engine, the visuals are breathtaking, with crisp textures and detailed environments. Every frame feels like a scene from a mythological world. The cutscenes are especially impressive, like watching anime-style fights with realistic graphics.  The world is gorgeous, but it's not open-world. Instead, it’s more linear, with invisible walls that sometimes break immersion. While I understand blocking access with cliffs or rocks, running into invisible barriers is frustrating. I wish the game allowed more freedom to explore.  Level design is good overall, though I missed some side quests due to how levels are designed. It’s a small issue, but for players who like to catch everything in one go, it can be annoying.  The gameplay is where the game truly shines. Though it borrows elements from Souls-like games, it feels more like a mix of Jedi: Fallen Order, Nioh, and God of War. The combat is smooth, fun, and evolves with new mechanics introduced throughout the game. The progression system is rewarding, letting you feel your character’s growth. The game offers a variety of spells, abilities, and nearly 80 bosses, many of which provide tough, satisfying challenges.  The skill tree is balanced and well-designed, making every skill useful. Unlike other games where most skills feel pointless, here every upgrade matters. To unlock all skills, you need to reach level 342, which keeps the gameplay exciting and rewards mastery of combat.  However, the game has performance issues. On my RTX 4060, certain areas and cutscenes caused frame drops. Console players have reported similar problems. Despite these technical flaws, the game is still an amazing experience.  In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredibly fun and well-crafted game with an engaging story, smooth gameplay, and breathtaking visuals. I give it a 9.8/10, losing a bit for not being open-world and for some performance issues. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out on one of the best gaming experiences ever!",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199184291217,135.1,0

The bosses are pretty tough and you'll find yourself grinding on them to get them down, or at least I did and I do play a good deal of these types of games.   Character progression feels pretty great so far, though I'm really just starting the game. There seems to be plenty of reasons to backtrack, multiple paths to take, and ways to skip bosses and still progress if you're feeling overwhelmed or under-geared.  The best thing about the game, though, is the story. I'm a bit biased because I've watched The Journey to thet West tv adaptation and really enjoy The Monkey King's story. This allows me to put together some pieces that may be lost in translation. This game doesn't replay that original MK story but,, similar to LOTRO, has you follow, revisit, or augment some characters and places that The Monkey King visited in that story.   It looks great, and many performance and visual issues I experienced on AMD CPU & GPU when the game launched have been resolved.

Story: Just like Elden Ring or any other soulsborn this game’s story is convoluted and intricate, you have to work for the story to understand and read the lore and maybe watch a YouTube video, but the story is fascinating and grandeur. There are plenty of NPCs in the game that continue the story of the game, it’s based on a novel Journey to the West and is full of mythical creatures of all sorts, I had tons of fun reading and exploring about those creatures.  Combat: The combat in this game is nothing short of perfection, it’s fluid, quick, responsive and solid. There are multiples techniques for you to use with combos and transformations that let you transform into different creatures that you’ve bested previously. This game has one of the best combat’s I’ve experienced. The best part of the game is the 80+ boss battles which are spectacular to view, hard to fight and a pure satisfaction to beat.   Exploration: in extremely rewarding there are so many hidden areas and boss encounters that you will go out of your way to explore every corner. The game’s environment is loaded with hidden treasures, loot and new NPCs. From lush forests to ancient ruins, the realm of Black Myth Wukong is surely a magnificent place to explore, brimming with life and intrigue.   Graphics: in Black Myth Wukong are certainly a treat to behold. The magnificent visuals bring the game's environment to life in spectacular detail. From the character design to the surroundings, every part of the game's visuals is a monument to the developers' passion to their craft. Black Myth Wukong is a visual feast that demonstrates the full capabilities of current gaming visuals.   Overall, Black Myth Wukong is a masterpiece in game design, a gripping story, absolutely incredible combat, wondrous exploration, and gorgeous graphics. It is a must-play experience that sets a new benchmark for gaming quality. I offer Black Myth Wukong a well-deserved rating of 9.5 out of 10.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198106830490,39.6,446
2024-10-15 14:37,186.4,推荐,"**Black Myth: Wukong – Review**  **Pros:** ""Black Myth: Wukong"" marks Game Science's debut into AAA gaming, and what a stunning entry it is! The game is visually breathtaking, with its gorgeous environments and detailed character designs. The combat system is exhilarating, though it can be quite challenging for newcomers. It rewards patience and precision, and the sense of satisfaction you get from perfectly dodging an enemy's attacks is unmatched. Even though there is no parry mechanic, the dodge system feels unique and highly effective, making every battle feel strategic and intense. the sound design deserves special praise as well. From the clash of weapons to the ambient noises of the world, every sound feels meticulously crafted to pull you deeper into the experience. Enemies in the game are diverse, keeping the combat fresh, and the boss fights are particularly notable for their creativity and uniqueness. one standout aspect is the anime-style storytelling that unfolds at the end of each chapter. These moments add a distinct artistic flair to the game, giving it a touch of originality in terms of narrative presentation.  **Cons:** That said, the game isn’t without its flaws. Chapter 6, in particular, feels like a bit of a slog. The large map offers little in terms of exploration, and the pacing drags down the excitement that the earlier parts of the game build up. Additionally, Wukong as a character feels a bit too silent and emotionally distant. You never really connect with him on a deeper level, which can make the experience feel more like you're mindlessly fighting bosses rather than investing in the story of the protagonist.  **Conclusion:** Despite these few shortcomings, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is an amazing game, and for me, it's one of the best of 2024. I completed the game 100%, which took around 80+ hours, and the journey was absolutely worth it. If you're a fan of God of War or hack-and-slash combat systems, I highly recommend giving this game a try. Game Science has crafted something truly special, and I’m excited to see where they take their talents next.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198291817914,186.8,126

2024-10-13 22:49,41.3,推荐,"Took me some time to think up what i wanted to say about this game but all in all this was a very fun experience and makes me very excited for what other studios in china produce.. Im looking at YOU Phantom blade zero.  With its ARPG approach with certain souls elements it was a fun ride to go through, I was going into this game expecting it to just be like any standard souls-like but it doesn't quite hit that nail on the head to fit into it other than the generic archetypes that you find in that genre.  From start to beginning the quality of each boss fight was widely engaging and had me wondering what each one would end up being like the further i got into the game, especially with the variety that comes from all bosses than it being simply a large human with a sword.  I do wish there was more engagement from the cast throughout the game, shoutout to Zhu Bajie my absolute GOAT of the entire story and his arc that you have with the spider ladies. For once in that entire story the Spider arc & connection for Zhu baije was genuinely the best part of the game story wise.. i would be telling a lie if i said it didn't get me emotional.  Overall this game does a great job at making a fun ARPG with an interesting fighting loop until you've essentially mastered it.. to slowly get bored of it towards the very end. The animations between each chapter and the secret ending wrapped up this game perfectly for me.  Once again, i love you zhu bajie.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198251756486,42.2,339
2024-10-12 08:51,38.8,推荐,"9/10 if you like Souls-style dodge-dodge-dodge-hit style combat, 8/10 otherwise. The combat is slightly faster paced than tradition Dark Souls but not quite to the point of pure button smashing, and some bosses give sufficient challenge. Note: there is no difficulty slider so if you are bad at souls combat, you might face a few walls. Build variety is marginal but there are few different abilities to choose from and tricks to learn if you want to get good, but you don't really need to learn any combos to beat the game.  Graphics: Decent on regular monitors, surprisingly bad on HDR capable monitors. The game has weird dark grey fog filling all dark places and corners that clears up as you walk near, which is very jarring on displays with good black levels. The game intentionally makes you half-blind in dark places for no reason and negates any advantage of having an OLED display. Regular displays are less affected because they cannot portray dark areas properly anyway.  Story: Simple and functional, few annoying cases where the player is defeated in a cutscene but overall works very well for a game like this where gameplay is the focus. Leans a bit into lore, but not so much that you would need to read the journey to the west. Characters are good, even the sidekick is a rare case for not being annoying and useless and has some touching moments.  The game earns a lot of style points. Lots of art and optional lore to be read, and the chapter ending cutscenes are especially cool. The game is very trimmed in a good way: no babbling comedy characters, no useless dialog (main character does not talk, which is the best thing ever), no stupid monetization attempts, no grind (unless you really want to), no pure cosmetics. The game does not even have a map, which actually makes exploration much more enjoyable, and the main route is simple enough to follow that you won't get lost in the semi-open world. However, you will likely need to check guides to get every secret boss fight.   In short, Black Myth Wukong is an old fashioned game in every good sense. Technically not very original, but the foundation is solid and the setting is fresh since Chinese mythology has been rarely explored in videogames.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198034288374,39.5,0

2024-10-11 23:29,40.9,推荐,"A truly awesome game and an amazing first project from a studio. And from China as well, so that gets bonus pride points from me.  Amazing unique setting that draws on Journey to the West, fluid combat, varied and complex skill and gear system that allows for different builds, and lots, LOTS of bosses to fight. Mechanically, the game is very clearly inspired by Souls games and other action games like God of War, and it's equally satisfying to play.  The story is good, but a bit too cryptic to understand. Unlike fromsoft games, where its esoteric feel of the setting contributes to the game's atmosphere and invites poetic interpretation, Black Myth's setting is based on a very defined Chinese Mythical setting with a lot of established backstories, and I think the game could have benefited from explaining some more instead of just throwing everything into the in-game wiki menu.  One major complaint I have is invisible walls, there's way too many and since this game hides a lot of secrets in its levels, I often had to bump everywhere just to check if I can go there or its just another invisible wall, which is pretty frustrating. Another complaint I have is a bit personal: most bosses felt too easy to me, I feel like I only need to learn the moveset of like 5 or so bosses to beat them and the rest can often be brute forced by just mashing dodge when enemies are attacking and throwing every skill at them when their cool-downs are over.  Overall a pretty great game. Here's to more projects like this from China in the future!",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198321598567,40.9,0

2024-10-09 03:28,20.5,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong é uma experiência inovadora no mundo dos jogos de ação. O que mais chama a atenção é a maneira como ele traz elementos de jogos soulslike, mas sem se render completamente a essa fórmula já conhecida. A gameplay é fluida, estratégica e ao mesmo tempo oferece uma liberdade que vai além do que se costuma ver nesse gênero.  O combate é intenso, exigindo habilidade e precisão, mas a variedade de movimentos e as habilidades do protagonista, inspiradas na lenda do Rei Macaco, dão uma nova dinâmica à jogabilidade. O jogador não fica restrito apenas a esquivas e ataques convencionais, há toda uma gama de opções para adaptar o estilo de luta conforme a necessidade, o que torna o combate mais dinâmico e menos previsível.  Os elementos visuais são outro ponto forte. O jogo apresenta um mundo belamente construído, inspirado na mitologia chinesa, com cenários impressionantes e criaturas que misturam o épico e o sobrenatural. Cada ambiente tem uma riqueza de detalhes que faz você querer explorar e descobrir mais sobre esse universo fantástico. A atmosfera é complementada por uma trilha sonora que captura perfeitamente o clima das batalhas e momentos de exploração.  O grande diferencial de Black Myth: Wukong é que, mesmo incorporando aspectos que lembram os soulslike, ele não se limita a seguir esse caminho à risca. A dificuldade e os desafios estão presentes, mas de uma forma que se sente mais orgânica e menos punitiva, permitindo que o jogador se envolva na história e nas mecânicas sem sentir que está apenas repetindo fórmulas antigas.  No geral, Black Myth: Wukong entrega uma experiência refrescante, misturando o melhor de um jogo desafiador com a inovação necessária para não parecer mais do mesmo. É um título que vai agradar tanto aos fãs de jogos mais exigentes quanto àqueles que buscam algo épico e diferente.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198384694306,22.2,159

2024-10-07 09:31,55.7,推荐,"Enjoyed this game quite a lot and would recommend, although at times it would really grind my gears. I've played maybe 2 hours of a souls/souls-like game before, and although many say its not similar to those games, I'd say the premise is sorta there in terms of the boss fights. This game I'd say is great as an intro to those sort of games, now I've completed this I will go on to play those games!  Some things that really annoyed me at times were: - The combat can at times feel janky; especially the dodging and item using. Sometimes it just wouldn't happen after numerous attempts. Some bosses had really dumb hit boxes or lack thereof.  - I think I used the Thrust stance once throughout the whole game, and Pillar was only used once I gained a certain weapon that utilises that stance. If not for that, I'd have used Smash stance solely, the other 2 just didn't appeal too much to bother using them.  - Mouth flaps are not synced for dubbed versions, small issue but annoying. And I don't get why the main character has no dialogue whatsoever, even just one or two lines here and there would suffice. Hard to make any connection with the character for this reason.  - Some side quests and secrets and the odd main story objectives were just too obscure to complete without having to search a guide online. I really hate having to resort to this shit, I'm not Sherlock Holmes.  - Some bosses are unavailable once you get to certain points in the game, some of these are optional ones you might not come across. I completed the main game and wanted to go back and defeat any bosses I'd missed. Unfortunately this again resorted to online guides for locations, I got to one and there was no boss. I found out later that you had to defeat it before getting to a certain point. Why is this even a thing, it's for a very few number of them throughout the game and there's just no reason for it. I immediately uninstalled at this point because 100% completion was made unattainable.  - I'm running a fairly decent rig with a Ryzen 9 5900X & 3080 yet I was getting on average 40-60 FPS with recommended settings. And I've definitely played better looking games in the past with much higher FPS e.g. RDR2. It was playable after making some setting changes and still looked pretty but in some areas I suffered with lower than ideal FPS, poor optimisation I imagine?  It's easy to point out the bad things, but I would still recommend this game 100% if you want a linear combat focused game with a multitude of bosses, some with a considerable challenge to overcome!",1,0.523809552192687988,76561197988083303,55.7,316

To me, it serves as a love letter to gamers who just want a cool hack n slash boss rush type game, NO microtransactions, NO battlepass, just pure fun.   Pros: - Story is good (albeit hard to understand without research) - Majority of bosses are really well designed - All the characters were likeable/portrayed very well - Combat system was amazing - You are rewarded after every little battle with amazing loot - The way respawning works in this game is perfect. sets you right outside where you died most of the time which I loved - This game was LONG, but in a good way, everytime you unlock something it was nice knowing I have hours of gameplay left to utilize and learn all the mechanics  Cons - Lack of play-style variety, I'm certain I used the same build/combos 90% of players used - This is my personal critique, but the lack of direction in a game as linear as this was frustrating most of the time, a mini-map or quest log would have been appreciated, turns out my first playthrough I missed a BUNCH of quests with cool rewards, you don't even get the true ending unless you do research which I don't like - Collision in this game was REALLY rough. I found Wukong floating above the ground slightly/ colliding with small things on the ground blocking the players controls (often leading to falling off the map) wasn't too bad but something I keep catching even 3 playthroughs in  Overall it was the most fun I've had so far in the 2024 releases, with some polishing and clearer in-game direction for the player, I could have seen myself liking this game more than I did, I still think it was very well done.  9/10",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198282174700,138.8,0

Original: Amazing boss fights. Amazing landscape and attention to details. Amazing music and fantastic Chinese mythology. Best game of the year for me!",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199013291095,155.8,155
2024-10-01 18:02,60.9,推荐,"[h1]Black Myth: Wukong – An Epic and Stunning Journey[/h1]  Black Myth: Wukong, delivers on the promise of an ambitious, breathtaking adventure that was first teased in the 2020 trailer. Despite the initial skepticism, the game lives up to the hype generated back then.  The excitement surrounding Wukong rests on three main pillars: beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay, and the familiar mythology of Journey to the West. The game breathes new life into the well-known story, combining stunning visuals with gameplay that perfectly captures the agility of the Monkey King.  The game's similarities with FromSoftware titles become apparent, especially in its difficulty and need for pattern memorization during boss fights. Yet, Black Myth: Wukong also sets itself apart—its progression system is much simpler, focusing on skill trees rather than the extensive attribute customization typical of Soulslike games.  Unlike most games of the genre, Wukong is far less punitive. Although challenging, it avoids the punishing consequences of losing significant progress upon death, making it more forgiving. Combat focuses on mastering timing, resource management, and using spells, each with distinct effects, offering strategic depth to the player.  The bosses in Wukong are generally entertaining, though there are instances where unfair hitboxes can make certain encounters frustrating. Moreover, navigating between boss battles can sometimes feel confusing, and the exploration lacks incentive, particularly toward the end of the campaign, which introduces an unnecessarily challenging sequence.  Visually, Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of impressive. It blends stunning graphics with anime and stop-motion sequences that add emotional depth to the story, although the episodic nature of the plot can leave some character motivations unclear.  Despite a few missteps, mainly due to the studio's inexperience, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic game, showcasing a remarkable technical achievement. It’s an ambitious adaptation of Journey to the West, and it sets the stage for Game Science to refine their approach and reach even greater heights in future titles.

After completing all achievements i can confidently say that except for the RNG drops, every single aspect of gameplay was engaging and forced you to focus on the game, be it beautiful graphical scenes or fluid combat. I do say the smash stance is a little bit OP compared to other stances since NG+3 and more, you use the smash stance more than the wukong stance because certain buffs and builds make it deal some severe damage even at that stage. Overall, it is a fantastic game and a strong contender for Game of the Year.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198319729309,86.4,81

2024-09-29 22:51,131.1,推荐,"I had the chance to dive into this game early, drawn in by its impressive Gamescom trailer, and let me tell you—it has surpassed all my expectations in the best way possible. From the moment I started playing, I was blown away by the sheer beauty and attention to detail in the graphics. The visuals are not just lifelike; they transport you into a world so vivid and immersive that it feels like you’re exploring a living, breathing landscape. Every scene is crafted with such precision, from the smallest environmental details to the grand, picturesque vistas, that it often feels more like you’re watching an epic film rather than playing a game.  The cinematics are awe-inspiring, seamlessly blending into the gameplay, giving the whole experience a cinematic flow that’s almost movie-like. But what truly stands out for me is the incredible artwork throughout the game, particularly the anime-style epilogues that close each chapter. These moments are a brilliant artistic touch, and they bring a unique flair that’s rarely seen in this genre. Each epilogue is like a work of art on its own, offering a beautiful, hand-drawn break from the intense action and immersing you even deeper into the story.  Now, I’m on my fifth playthrough, and I still find new details and moments to appreciate each time. The level of craftsmanship in both the design and storytelling makes it a game you can’t just experience once. There’s always something more to discover, be it in the intricacies of the combat, the depth of the world-building, or the stunning environments that are nothing short of mesmerizing.  If there’s one area where the game didn’t quite hit the mark for me, it would be the English dubbing, particularly for Wukong. The audio felt slightly underwhelming compared to the rest of the game’s exceptional quality. It wasn’t bad by any means, but it didn’t fully capture the depth and intensity of the character in the way I had hoped. However, this is a minor gripe in what is otherwise a masterclass in game design.  Overall, this game has been a phenomenal purchase—one that I can confidently recommend to any gamer, especially those who appreciate top-tier visuals, breathtaking art, and an unforgettable experience. It’s a true work of art in the gaming world, and I’m sure it will leave a lasting impression on anyone who plays it.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198157011816,137.4,0

Now its funny that when i bought the game and started chapter 1, the game made my monkey look like it had stage 8 cancer and i couldnt move when i wanted to. The game was actually playable when it got used to the graphics and that was 5 hours later i logged into the game. Obviously right ``oh its your graphics card`` ``oh its my memory (which probably is)`` but a game like this shouldnt destroy my entire pc.

The amount of story telling and visual experiences they put into the game is excellent and surpasses other souls like titles imo. Along with all of the gear and the different stance styles and abilities you can use to come close enough to the ""wukong"" experience is refreshing. The amount of world building that you can experience is also superb even though majority of the time there are no choices to make or actual impacts that you can take to change the environment or world. A couple of the complaints I would have is the amount of lag some would experience if your pc isn't up to specs, as well as the amount of invis walls but that comes with the linear, less exploratory areas. Would recommend to anyone who's looking for a decent amount of difficulty to other souls and a ""god of war"" like experience.

2024-09-29 03:24,59.3,推荐,"I usually don’t play ""soulslike"" games, but I tried Black Myth: Wukong because it’s not as dark and gothic as others like Elden Ring or Dark Souls. The game’s full ray tracing was a big draw for me, and it didn’t disappoint.   I played on an AMD 5800X CPU, 64 GB RAM, NVMe M.2 SSD Samsung 990 Pro, and Nvidia RTX 4080 Super GPU in 4K with DLSS Performance and full ray tracing. The game ran at a mostly stable 60 FPS, using around 12 GB RAM, with 23 GB utilized when I had other apps open.  As a newbie to this genre and a mouse-and-keyboard gamer, I found the game challenging at first but got the hang of it. I prefer story games and don’t enjoy repeatedly fighting hard bosses. I got stuck at the end boss of Chapter 2, deleted the game, then returned later and used cheats to progress.  The game’s chapters are beautifully made with a variety of enemies and customization options. You can reset skill points anytime, allowing for different loadouts. Unlike other soulslike games, Black Myth: Wukong offers cutscenes and a cinematic experience, which I appreciated. It tells a story with beautiful music, atmosphere, and fantastic visuals, making it enjoyable even for inexperienced players like me.

2024-09-27 20:58,93.5,推荐,"[h3]Being Ghosted for GOTY[/h3] [hr][/hr] Firstly, I’ll start off with calling out Cry Baby Inc. Do not listen to their garbage. This game holds true to Chinese lore and is truly a polished epic. All the hate on this and then seeing the soaring sales and active player counts made me purchase this out of curiosity. Wow was I amazed.  You can tell Game Science put a lot of love into this game. It’s not perfect by any means, but this is most certainly Game of the Year in my eyes. It’s sad we have big name reviewers such as IGN being overtaken by DEI boards and working with people like SBI who are purposely uglifying and ruining everything touched out of hatred for gamers and themselves.  Now to the game. There’s many positives and a few negatives I will get to. Overall completion took around 70 hours with completing almost everything. All bosses/side quests/secrets.  [b]Enjoyed:[/b] •	The combat system felt very fluid. I didn’t feel any delay and had a lot of fun with all the builds and styles. Straight forward, but takes some practice to really get the hang of counters/perfect dodges etc... I’m usually M&K but played this one on controller. It felt great.  •	Difficulty was perfect. I like that there’s no difficulty settings, one size fits all approach. Many people compare this to GOW or Elden Rings. I’ve only played Elden Rings so I can’t really compare the two. It has characteristics of Elden Rings but without all the dumb rage mechanics. I stopped playing Elden Rings about 70% through the game just due to all the annoying roadblocks the devs put into the game to annoy you. BMW has difficult bosses, but nothing was unbearable or too grindy. Elden Rings fails at this for casual gamers like me who do not want to spend 3-6 hours on 1 boss or hours finding a boss to only fall through the floor because there’s a hidden hole you can’t see unless you’ve already died to it…. You lose progression and time, it gets annoying, ultimately led to me losing interest in playing. There’s no loss of materials, xp or currency in BMW when dying. I also like how they separate the currency and XP unlike Elden Rings.   •	You can pause the game.  •	Crafting and medicines work without being annoying. Have purpose.  •	Exploration while sometimes felt linear, I was pleasantly excited after chapter 1 as the world opens much more. I never felt lost, never felt like I didn’t know what I needed to do next.  •	Environment was visually stunning. Very well made, and polished. Great performance on my PC. FPS was not capped. Looked awesome in 4K.   [b]Disliked:[/b] •	Out of the 70 hours I had 2-3 crashes. I’m on a high-end system and average about 100-120FPS on very high settings.   •	There were some chapters that didn’t seem as optimized as the earlier ones. Not highly noticeable.  •	Flying bosses/enemies, the camera will be your hardest obstacle. I felt like this needs some work/adjustment.  •	Some boss’s ultimate abilities make it very difficult to see. Not sure if this was done on purpose but it can be a bit annoying.  •	[spoiler]chapter 3 – jail felt very drawn out and long. Not my most enjoyable chapter [/spoiler]  Thank you for producing such a game and listening to the gamers. Game Science did a fantastic job with this, and I will be waiting for more DLC. It would be shameful to skip these games achievements due to a few ugly green haired creatures who are yet again offended.

The bosses are just the right amount of challenging to help you get better without being frustrating.  Exploration (9/10): Secret zones are a lot of fun to find! I just wish there were more puzzles or areas to explore. Would've been cool to have more hidden spots.  Graphics (10/10): The visuals are absolutely stunning—seriously one of the best-looking games I’ve ever seen. Every little detail is top-notch.  World Building (10/10): The world feels really unique, with every zone having its own vibe. It’s such a cool experience, especially with that awesome opening cutscene that pulls you right in.  Story (8/10): The cutscenes are great, but the story is delivered in a cryptic way, kinda like Elden Ring. Even after going through all the journals, it’s still hard to piece everything together.  Boss Design (10/10): The bosses are fun and not as punishing as Elden Ring. Only a few were annoying, but most were a good time. The Erlang Shen fight was the toughest and definitely my favorite.  What could be better: Sometimes the invisible walls take you out of the moment, but it’s a small thing.

2024-09-26 03:23,80.5,推荐,"Hello there. First time writing a review but imma share my experience rather just saying good or bad. Positive first and Negative later.(Post DLC announcement) Overall the game is a good experience for me, who is a gamer. The graphics are insanely demanding of pc resources, which is typical for an unreal engine 5 game. Despite medium graphics, I actually enjoyed it a lot. The story is good, not comparing to other games cause I feel it’s pointless, rather I could say compare the experience felt playing the game. The visuals and the story are depicted of Chinese culture which is really good and builds up the curiosity to know more about it. Well it’s not a soulslike game but the bosses are pretty fun, and I pushed like NG+3 and it’s getting a bit tough (First playthrough was hard and later NG+ and NG++ were just cheesing through) but yet to experience everything just find out whole rather than going through main routes (hidden bosses and stuff).  There are downsides obviously. The game feels awfully short; mind you, I just saw the announcement video day before yesterday where they actually planned to release 13 chapters (approx idk actual but it’s around that and imma purchase dlc fs), end chapter animation, pure art. Just pure art. Love the animation and backstory. Sometimes the game just gets laggy and I have to switch tab and back to game to stop it. There’s no map and exploring from Chapter 3 feels headache cause without walkthroughs (I used from NG+) it’s just circling the same area. Honestly without a map (Yes Sekiro has a map) it feels linear and not much exploration. The story is short and honestly it wasn’t a bit issue for me, cause Elden ring was massive to explore for me.   After getting or achieving the true ending, you actually know the reason of the game. I mean there’s no bad ending but it feels incomplete without clearing all the hidden bosses (and the hidden areas are good too). Overall I love the game and I won’t rate cause I can’t but let’s just say it’s in my Top 7 (Cyberpunk 1st obv, Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Battlefront II and RDR2). Hoping the new DLC would have new and exciting content, would like to see Wukong’s master and the Jade emperor (ifykyk the actual story).  Thanks for reading this.

The story is great, it really gets you invested to learn more about it, like the background of characters, what the relationship between them is, etc. - the game only got me more excited to learn about the full story and Chinese mythology in general. Yes, the storytelling can be a bit confusing and/or scattered all over the place, especially with some of the end-of-chapter cutscenes, but all the more reason to dive in to find out more about it!  While I get the comparison to Soulslike games, it isn’t exactly that. Yes, it borrows elements from Soulslike games, for example the mechanics of bosses, but it does play a lot easier than most Souls games. It’s much more forgiving, especially because of the simple fact that if you die, it’s not really a problem. You just respawn at the latest shrine and you don’t lose any progress or items in that sense.  All in all, I loved everything about it and I wish it would’ve been more chapters, but it’s fair enough that they couldn’t realize that with the budget they had.

The difficulty is great as well, not easy but not difficult while still dying to bosses 0-10 times. Challenging but manageable if you're focused and check that you haven't missed something. I also love how you can respec your character for free which gives a lot of freedom with trying new things and different combinations. Especially if your playstyle isn't doing well against a certain boss, you can change it.

2024-10-18 22:29,0.1,推荐,"Played it on a differnt account.  Black Myth: Wukong is a breathtaking masterpiece that seamlessly weaves Chinese mythology into a visually stunning action RPG. Developed by Game Science, this game takes players on an epic journey through the rich world of Journey to the West, offering a fresh and engaging narrative that both honors and reinterprets the classic tale.  Visuals and Art Direction: One of the standout features of Black Myth: Wukong is its stunning graphics. The environments are lush and detailed, bringing to life the vibrant landscapes of ancient China. Character designs are equally impressive, with the Monkey King, Wukong, rendered in a way that captures both his mischievous spirit and formidable power. The animation is fluid, making combat sequences exhilarating and visually striking.  Gameplay Mechanics: The gameplay is a masterclass in combat design, blending fast-paced action with strategic elements. Players can utilize Wukong’s shapeshifting abilities to adapt to different combat scenarios, providing a dynamic experience. The variety of enemies and intricate boss battles keep the gameplay fresh and challenging, ensuring players are always on their toes.  Narrative and Characters: The storytelling is rich and immersive, exploring themes of loyalty, courage, and identity. Wukong's journey is not just about defeating foes; it's about understanding his place in the world and the responsibilities that come with power. The supporting characters are well-developed, adding depth to the narrative and enhancing the overall experience.",4,0.523622035980224609,76561199378833956,0.1,0

2024-10-08 12:31,37.5,推荐,"This is not the traditional type of game that I play.  I usually like turn-based games like X-Com.  As I have gotten older (I'm now 61 years old), I have avoided FPS and any games that relies on fast accurate reflexes and reaction times.  I am just terrible at those types of games.  However, I am also an ABC (American Born Chinese) and was intrigued by the rave reviews that Black Myth: Wukong was getting.  I am not familiar with the ""Journey to the West"" stories either and I thought it would be cool to play this game to learn a little bit of my heritage.  Okay, long story short:  I am having a ton of fun playing this game.  Right now, I'm at about 37 hours and I am at the beginnings of Chapter 2 so I'm taking a long leisurely time playing it (also because this is not the typical type of game that I play so I'm not good at it compared to a lot of other people).  To my surprise, I have been successful at beating more bosses and getting further into the game than I thought possible.  I sort of expected to be stuck at the first boss and eventually quit in frustration.  However, the game seems to allow the user to eventually be able to beat any boss by allowing us to gain experience (to gain skills) and freely rearrange our skills so that we eventually get to the point where we can beat a boss.  At least, that's my hope.  And it's really satisfying when you do beat a boss.   I have encountered 2 or 3 bosses where it took me awhile to either figure out how (or be lucky enough or gain enough skills) to eventually beat them.  If you encounter a boss you can't beat, you can just go around beating lesser opponents until you can level up and gain a skill that might help.  And I have encountered some bosses where I was able to beat them on the first try.  I am fearful that I will eventually encounter a boss that I can't beat and quit the game.  I hope that with patience, I will be able to beat all the bosses I encounter and be able to finish the game.  I really hope that I can finish the game.  The game is very polish and beautiful.  It even plays and looks great on lesser hardware (I'm playing with an Intel Arc A380).   I'm having a lot of fun and I find the story to be interesting (although a lot of times I don't really know what is going on since I am not familiar with the source material).  It has given me interest in learning more about the source material it is based on.  I'll probably end up watching some of those Journey to the West movies with Stephen Chow (I did see one awhile ago and I remember that I thought it was very funny and entertaining but I will probably enjoy it more now as I slowly learn more about the Monkey King myth)  Overall, I do highly recommend this game.",9,0.622397780418395996,76561197999542709,143.2,0

Game play is great, (most) bosses are enjoyable, graphics are insane, and don't even get me started on the short animated films at the end of each chapter - they're really what set this game apart for me.  The story itself is great, the over-arching story, while basic, is really there to set up the ""Why am i here"" and then each chapter has its own sub-story that you get to explore. I think the main thing with the story(s) is that they really benefit from knowing Journey to the West. As someone who knew bits and pieces, i personally found that it played a lot like a soul game in the sense that i was constantly going through text to find backstories, or finding explanations online, but the difference was that i was still understanding the big moments as they happened (such as first meeting you-know-who in chapter 3).  Don't get me wrong, it does have a few issues, namely optimisation (4090 so i was fine), the invisible barriers that can be immersion breaking at times, and the entirety of chapter 6 which just feels like they tried to make an open world chapter and gave up half way. But given that this is the devs first attempt at a game, i can look past these issues, especially given that the end product is still better then 99% of modern AAA games.  There is only 1-2 games a year that make me want to play every waking hour, and given that SOTE was a DLC, this is without doubt my GOTY. I really look forward see what the devs do with the DLC's, no doubt i won't be sleeping much when they do release.",1,0.522058844566345215,76561198860834949,62.5,0

Even now, almost 5 months after release I can't get consistent 60+fps without dlss in performance(!) mode and several grafics settings set to medium and I have a high end pc (4090, r9 5950X, 64gb ram)!  The levels are mostly linear with a few different routes leading to smaller open(ish) areas, and all of them have tons of invisible walls, which can make exploration somewhat annoying. Level design is full on eye-candy, but there are a lot of muddy textures in almost every area of the game. You can clearly see that many assets have been scaled without adjusting the textures. Also there are so many places that look like they're reachable, but aren't, so if you're the exploring type like me, this can become really annoying.  I also got stuck on small rocks and bushes several times that shouldn't block me at all.  In some areas the game feels like you're playing a boss rush mode, some bosses are simply too close to each other, and speaking of bosses: balancing is not the greatest, some bosses are severely overpowered while others barely scratched me.  The story is decent and honestly told in a -for me- more immersive way than in the soulsborne series, though it's an old story that has been told many times in many different forms of media, so chances are you've heard it before...  Some ideas that get introduced early in the game, get dropped immediately and you'll never see them get used again, which makes them rather pointless to even introduce.  I could go on and on, but let me just wrap it up and say the game is decent overall, not bad at all, but no masterpiece either. Far from it honestly. Seeing how highly (over)rated it is, you'd think it's the best game ever, which it isn't, so I rather give it a thumbs down. DS, Bloodborne and Elden Ring (and even some non-from souls-likes) are all better games imo, and none of them is rated as high as this game. Also a supposed AAA game shouldn't have such a bad performance, and again: this is not a bad game, but also not a masterpiece, just a decent game that needs some fixes.",2,0.52173912525177002,76561197993014543,30.5,0

From gameplay to art direction to story and soundtrack it feels so polished and with a lot of attention to details especially when it comes to how well designed and unique each of the bosses feel even compared to the best games this industry has to offer in the action/adventure genre. When it comes to how satisfying it feels to fight most of the bosses, I`ve been, more than once, comparing it to Sekiro or Monster Hunter World, even tho I don't find it as satisfying, it's the closest experience I had. If I had to complain about something, it would be the high amount of reading I had to do to finish the journal, it's not something I would usually complain about but this time I felt like it maybe was a bit too much, like for example going 10 minutes through chapter 4 I already had 8 new entries and had to take a pretty considerable break to go through it all, while I enjoyed every entry and felt like it was worth reading everything, maybe they could use some voice acting to make them more enjoyable, but this is nitpicking more than anything else.  Never understood the hate for invisible walls but it's so usual for most of the action/adventure linear games that I don't see how anyone that's used to the genre can even be surprised about anymore.  Overall the game offered much more than I ever expected and then more while keeping the high quality that it showed from the opening(that's probably the best opening to a game ever) throughout all of the 6 chapters, while also providing enough replayability.

I am a Souls like snob so the combat was appealing to me even though it's not that hard (for the most part), but what sold me were the visuals and the presentation that this game encapsulates beautifully.  The story is told through these gorgeous cut-scenes with superb art styles that convey the happenings and the past at the start of every chapter. Each of the story feels even better than the previous one and the characters and events represented in these are the highlights. The story and characters's lore goes very deep and is a great introduction to those who want to know more about The journey to the west.  All that said no matter what, at the end of the day it is a game and as far as gameplay goes it is a very fun, mildly challenging and very rewarding game. It takes a bit of time to get used to the mechanics and just to the sheer quantity of them. The abilities are fun and the variety between enemies especially the bosses keeps this game always interesting. I feel like I'm a child again playing Dark souls 1 not having a clue what's around the corner and using 10 items just in sheer excitement and fear about what's to come next.  Conclusion- For me it's an 8.5/10.

They were right to refuse collaboration with ""SWEET BABY INC,"" despite various threats of censorship from that entity. This game honors the story of the Monkey King in its entirety. What stands out is the complete absence of the wokeness that often taints the gaming landscape. I purchased the Deluxe version without hesitation. This game also remains untouched by the pressures of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion); it is quite rare in today's world to find a game devoid of politicization. Despite numerous Western journalists assigning it low scores due to their own corruption (if you seek hidden vices, follow the money), the sales figures tell a different story—numbers do not lie. Nowadays, I notice that to find a truly excellent game with challenging content and graphics worthy of the Unreal Engine 5, one must look towards the Asian market.

But after finishing one complete play through I felt compelled to write my review. This game is ABSOLUTE cinema. It is a pure Master Piece. In my humble opinion there are no other contenders for Game of the Year in 2024. Any GOTY nomination which leaves this game out is invalid. Wukong as a studio first release was impressive on it's own, for combat, story telling, cinematics, sound track. There are several triple AAA studios that don't even come close to the level of quality, artistic design and passion put into telling this games story. Boss design is so good and the game always gives a way to figure the fights out.  This game not being fully open world is a complaint I heard alot and believe me when I say it takes nothing away from this game.   I can't wait to see what Game Science does next.

2025-02-23 01:08,86.6,不推荐,"I can't suggest this game. I really want to, because I did really enjoy this game and I did finish the main campaign. There are, however, some performance issues and some very not intuitive hidden mechanics that can make this game extremely frustrating.  Pros: - beautiful game - fun combat (when it works like it is expected to) - very forgiving and flexible build / specialization system (you can respec without penalty at any shrine) - interesting story / lore (though to be honest I still don't fully understand it, but it was all very interesting and pretty)  Cons - Performance issues (actions wouldn't go off even though there isn't an evident reason it would fail) - Non-intuitive and unexplained mechanics - Some of the spec points are trash (I'm looking at you vengeful mirage) - Some of the talents' descriptions are just wrong - Some talent points I think are just flat bugged or possibly so hard to understand that I never saw it do what it is supposed to do - Some of the gear is trash - Some of the boss fights just don't leave up long enough openings (I'll go in more detail below) - I can't believe I'm saying this, but the game's trash mobs can be ignored (unless you are searching or grinding levels) - Parts of the game that are ""optional"" aren't, and those basically require a guide (my odds of figuring out how to get the Weaver's Needle would have been nil without a guide) - Broken Shell's P1 -> P2 cutscene is tooooooo long and not skippable - Boss fights that don't have a shrine outside it and making you run back a long ways (luckily trash mobs can be run by) - Has boss fights with health bars that lie. I hate getting a boss to 0%, get a cutscene, they go back to full health and enter a new phase. Just put all their health into one flipping bar and have the phases transitions at certain health check points.  Mixed - This is a boss fight game. I liked that, the trash is mostly ignorable once you have explored an area. This game feels like it is 100 bosses to every 1 trash mob. I did enjoy that the game leans so heavy into boss fights, but for some I could see how it kills the power fantasy of mowing through trash mobs. - Dodge. Dodge. DODGE. DODGE. DODGE. DOoooooDDDDDDGE.  Boop the boss on the nose. Dodge. Dodge. DODGE...... - Multiple endings. I really want to put this in the Cons section, but I recognize other people actually like multiple endings in games. I don't bother with alternate endings, once I see roll credits I am ready to move on.  This is probably my third Souls-like. I have played Dark Souls: Remastered, Tunic (aka Fox Souls), and now Wukong. While none of the games are the exact same, I feel that the combat, overlay UI design, and use of shrines are similar enough to constitute putting them all as Souls-like. Don't get me wrong about this game, I did overall enjoy this game, but I don't recommend it because I think there are some things that should get fixed that were extremely frustrating that isn't just it being hard.  I'll cover my gripe about some of the bosses not giving big enough openings. It feels like you go on for a string of 8 or more dodges from a boss, possibly lasting 10 - 20 seconds, and the only chance you get to retaliate after successfully doing that is one ore two quick hits that may only net you 1-5% of the bosses health. So then you are probably like me, get good and do those dodges, respec into getting more heavy attack points from dodging so you can do a big heavy hit when an opening happens.... then the boss dodges your heavy attack by taking a half step back. Like the boss wasn't even mechanically doing an intentional dodge, he just steps back as the final move of a long string of attacks and accidentally does a dodge.  One of the more frustrating things is what I'm going to call the power levels of attacks. A higher level attack will likely cancel through the opponent's lower level attack, possibly even staggering the victim. I'll put a player light attack at 1, a player heavy attack at 2, boss regular attack 2, light attack combo finisher 3, boss heavy attack 3, player ""seeing through"" attack 3, player fully charged heavy attack 4, player skyfall strike 4, boss haymaker / counter attack 5, with unfinished or not attacking at 0 for both. So the seeing through being able to be staggered through is probably one of the more frustrating ones, the talent description for resolute strike is that it ""sees through the enemy and nullifies damage"". This makes you think that it is basically a perfect dodge that deals damage in the animation of an attack, but it isn't. If a boss hits you at the same time as you attempt a resolute strike and it is on a higher level it will stagger you, eat your focus point, still damage you, and not damage the boss. For most of the game, I hadn't formed this idea of how the attack mechanics work, feeling like landing a resolute strike was more about luck than good timing. Really though, most of the time I was just pulling off a varied combo to lead into a skyfall strike, which rarely ever got countered and frequently staggers the boss.  Skyfall Strike leads me into the game's talents' bad descriptions. I loved Skyfall Strike, it was probably 60% of my damage through out the game. The description though, is just wrong. It says you can execute it after a resolute strike, but fortunately, this strictly, isn't true. You can Skyfall Strike after a resolute strike or a varied combo. A varied combo is just a heavy attack after a light attack. A resolute strike is just a varied combo that is perfectly timed like a perfect dodge. Strictly speaking, being able to do a Skyfall Strike after a varied combo shouldn't be possible, because according to the ability's description you haven't met the criteria of a resolute strike, but who cares you still get your Skyfall Strike by not being super good. It is just confusing and I went with it and was happy that it was a bug in my favor. On the other hand, Peace from Peril, I have no idea how it is supposed to work. Either the description is so bad that I don't understand what it is supposed to do or it just is bugged. I know I did perfect dodges while charging, but I still saw my focus disappear.  The input lag / performance issues is a tough one to comprehend in this game. So much of the game requires perfect timing that when you felt like you did something right but still take a blow, it can be frustrating and want to blame the game's performance. At times you can't take another action because many things in this game are ""weighty"" and the animation for the action has to complete. So you and the boss both go for a light attack, both land but theirs staggers you, you have to wait for you to stand before you can dodge or attack, so they hit you with a combo attack, and by this point you are still waiting for an animation to stand to complete, you dodge but your timing is off because of the wait on stand animation, you dodge nothing and when it isn't necessary, the boss lands another combo attack and staggers you again, the boss is landing a heavy attack finisher that puts you out. While all this is happening, in your head you have been just trying to get a dodge in but can't. It can feel like it is bad performance or lag, but if thought of as power levels and weight of actions it seems reasonable. At other times you take damage because of the ""attack levels"" concept I explained earlier. I want to say that Immobolize is probably only a level 2 attack, so if a boss is going for a 3 or higher attack, they will just ignore your Immobolize, use some mana, and put Immobolize on cooldown. These concepts can make it feel like the game has bad performance, but looking back, I think it is just poorly described or poorly designed mechanics.   Sadly, the hidden mechanics without descriptions end up being the most important at being successful in this game. And that is the main reason I can't recommend this game.",7,0.519991874694824219,76561198090692296,86.6,0

The character and environmental models, although visually impressive at first glance, often feel rushed or lack fine detail. For example, some NPCs and background elements appear poorly textured or unfinished, breaking the immersion and undermining the otherwise well-executed combat sequences. These shortcomings stand in stark contrast to the level of detail and polish expected from a game of this magnitude. Additionally, the storyline deviates significantly from the core essence of Journey to the West, a beloved Chinese classic. The game seems more focused on flashy action and spectacle rather than staying true to the deep philosophical and cultural themes that make the original story so compelling. As a fan of Chinese mythology, I expected a more nuanced narrative, but instead, what we get is a simplified, action-driven tale that doesn't quite capture the soul of the source material.",1,0.517241418361663818,76561199195676520,73.9,0

You Pretty much get to be a monkey and be hated by the higher ups. . The music and story telling do a great Job Especially in Chapters 2 and 4 please note the game does have Replay Value    with different endings. .Environment was Really well Designed in Levels i found myself in Different Areas such As a forest   Desert and snow. .Your main weapon is a pole that Extends and changes with the skills you choose and build around .you get different abilities and powers which can change the way you fight.  Cons  .You will have to deal with Difficult bosses at the start of the game Early There is no Difficulty Slider at all so for people who are casuals at gaming this is the not the game for you go back to Pal-world or just get good and watch Walkthroughs or the game has friendly Facebook Community that will help you out.  Sometimes i Experienced the Game Crashing during boss fights when using Abilities and powers but that was Quickly patched out and patches are quite large so Be prepared but the game was still worth it. The quest system wont hand hold you so don't expect it to.

It’s like stepping straight into the Chinese mythology with Wukong himself (I know I know, he is/isn't the one). The visuals are insane, the gameplay is extremely addictive, and the challenges pull you right in from the start. It’s like you’re really on this legendary journey...  The graphics are honestly something else. Every environment feels alive, from misty mountains to shadowy forests, and the enemies are so detailed they feel like they’re straight out of an old myth. The combat is buttery smooth, too. Every move and transformation just flows and making it so satisfying to play. You can tell the devs really poured their hearts into every detail of this world.  The gameplay is as intense as it is rewarding. The combat is strategic, challenging, and never feels cheap. Wukong’s transformations and abilities are epic and add so much fun to the combat. Though you may have to try a few transformations at first to figure out which best suits you ;P  Honestly, BMW feels like more than a game...it’s an experience all imho. It brings the old legends to life with a fresh twist that anyone can get into, and Western players like myself will find it especially cool and unique. I seriously can’t wait to see what else the devs have planned as they keep building on this.   -- Conclusion --------------- If you’re into interesting myths, epic action gameplay, and jaw-dropping visuals, you have to play this one.  10/10 on my list, no bs!",2,0.516129076480865479,76561199145232925,135.2,0

After sinking over 106 hours into this gem (including an NG+ run because once clearly wasn’t enough), I have to say—this game is an absolute BANGER. Game Science has outdone itself, and I’ll be honest, AAA studios need to be taking notes. Enough with their Microtransactions and “Oops! You accidentally locked the real ending behind a $30 DLC purchase”—just give us a game, man!  Every chapter in this game is like unwrapping a new present. The difficulty feels perfectly tailored to whatever mood you're in. Feeling invincible? Crank it up. Got emotional baggage? Maybe dial it back. It’s all there, and it’s all beautifully crafted.  That said, I do have one gripe (because of course, nothing's perfect). Some areas feel like they came straight out of an empty void, devoid of anything interesting. I mean, if I’m trekking across the vast wastelands of this majestic world, the least you could do is give me a shiny trinket or a creepy lore tidbit to chew on. Nope, nada. Some places are so barren that you’d think they were reserved for some DLC, and let’s face it—they probably are.  But hey, those moments aside, this game is an absolute treat. A contender for GOTY?

2024-12-02 06:58,44.5,推荐,"[h1]  A unique game, but a bit overrated [/h1]  Don't get me wrong, Black Myth Wukong is a fantastic game, a welcome addition to the AAA collection and for the first ever AAA Chinese game? It's great, one of the most unique experiences I have ever had, and experiencing this country's Culture in a video game was amazing, as I do enjoy it a lot,  Aditionally I love SoulsBorne games, with Elden Ring, BloodBorne and Sekiro being one of my favorite games of all time, and this game's combat is similar to those games, but with that being said, I still have some gripes with it that I will mention later.  [h2] The combat and enemies [/h2]  I can see how some people claim that it's repetitive and I do agree with that to some point, but I don't think it's the combat's fault but rather another factor that i will get into later.  With that being said, I think that the combat is good, it has some variety with the skill tree and all the abilities you have, the only issue is that these abilities and upgrades all lead up to the same gameplay loop which is spamming abilities and trying to maximize damage along with stunning the enemy, but even so it's not to a huge degree, so yeah I had fun with the combat.  The enemies are honestly very nice, Wukong is FULL of variety regarding the enemy types and bosses: honestly this game has so many different bosses, of course, not all of them are excellent and almost all of these were pretty easy to beat, but I found most of them fun to fight.  [h2] The Intro, The Journey  [/h2]  Black Myth Wukong's Introduction is spectacular, it shows the end of Sun Wukong in an epic battle, and the start of your character's journey, that being said: This game doesn't focus too much on it's ""Story"", It's really more of a Journey that you and your character go through which I did enjoy along with the ending.  The characters were also entertaining to watch, especially the boar guy (i forgot his name lol).   [h2] Uniqueness and Visuals [/h2]   I have never played a game close to this, the Visuals and Art design are great, being inspired by of course, Chinese Culture and Mythology, executed in a beautiful way in all of the chapters of this experience.  And one more thing that I did enjoy a lot were the end of the chapter Shorts, basically at the end of a chapter there is a Video/Cutscene that plays, and these were very surprising to see, in a pleasant way, one was made with stop motion and told a great tale, one with cartoonish animation and 2 if I'm not wrong with a kind of Anime animation.  [h2] The Negatives [/h2]  There are only a few problems with this game:  Exploration, which is limited by Invisible walls a lot of the time, what I mean is that you get a false sense of Openness and Grandness in this game, it's honestly very annoying at times to get blocked by invisible walls when you re just trying to find new places to explore.  And finally, Length, this game is too long for it's own good in my opinion, to be fair, I did beat some of the side content, but I didn't go out of my way to finish all of it, still I felt like this game was starting to drag after a while. I think that Chapter 3 and 4 dragged on for way too long and could have been shorter, this is because as I have said, as good as the combat is, the variety was not enough to keep me hooked for 45 hours of gameplay, this game does not have any breaks from the combat at all, the only thing you do is fight, I think that they should have incorporated some other mechanic to give you a break from the game and maybe made the game itself a bit shorter.  [h2] Conclusion [/h2]  A good, unique experience, dragged down by it's length and repetitiveness. I do recommend it, even at a full price, it's a very good game, but it's far from a masterpiece.",4,0.565217375755310059,76561199062332644,44.5,183

2024-11-28 15:21,41.6,推荐,"Wukong exceeded all of my expectations. From the very beginning, the intro is beyond epic. Celestial Court, Erlang. The Four Heavenly Kings.  Animations, transitions, and overall directing are of a very high quality.  It is an adventure game, much like God of War 2018 or Fallen Order. However, unlike those two, the levels are incredibly linear without any metroidvania elements, which is a big improvement in my eyes; there is almost no copy-paste and no back tracking.   [b]Gameplay:[/b] The core itself is janky; hitboxes, responsiveness, getting locked into animations and timings aren't perfect. Even though difficulty is fixed, the game itself isn't very hard if you explore thoroughly and kill all of the bosses. Most of the bosses won't pose a challenge. Level design in acts 3, which is the weakest part of the game, and 6 is lacking. Also, invisible walls are annoying.  However, the variety of bosses and enemies is incredibly good. 100+ [b]unique[/b] bosses is a commendable achievement. Which is more than Elden Ring has, for example. Fighting in Wukong never felt repetitive to me, despite those flaws. Progression feels relevant for the most part, but closer to the middle you just dump it into stats. There are several abilities to choose from. Combat itself is decent; there are many skills to use, and they are mostly restricted by cooldown, which is a good thing. You use your whole arsenal, 5 abilities and 1 vessel, in every boss fight. It is not about spamming dodge/parry or one skill/attack. Many people praise the combat, but it's not the strongest part of the game.   [b]Story:[/b] It is good if you didn't read the book. Zhu Baije, main villains and side characters are well written.  But after reading forums and two volumes of The Journey to the West, I could say the story gets even better. A lot of attention to detail. Black Myth: Wukong captures the spirit of the book and amplifies it through visuals. Which is a great achievement in itself.  Every chapter you get a great self-contained story. At the end of each chapter, there is a cartoon explaining the backstory of the characters participating. Those cartoons are very touching and beautiful. The soundtrack reinforces that feeling. Even without understanding the backstory, a lot of cutscenes and interactions are very epic and gorgeous looking. For some people it might be hard to follow at times; it tries to tell a lot of things without over-explaining.   Definitely a must-play for those who like the adventure genre or read TJTTW. For the longest time, I wanted a next-gen epic mythology-based game; Wukong satisfied my urge.",5,0.564297854900360107,76561198018148205,41.6,865

2024-12-01 20:48,46.4,推荐,"[h1] Introduction [/h1] Think need to start from an information - I’ve been waited for this game for a long time, pre-ordered it and finished it in just a few days. Black Myth Wukong (later Wukong) really impressed me, while before the great release I was really worried that game may be not such good as developers presented it. I was worried about Unreal Engine 5 (later UE5), as not so many developers showed well opportunities about this Engine, and usually players had problem with optimization. The same questions were about gameplay and plot. So as you may understand - before the release there were much more questions then answers.  [h1] Plot [/h1] The story pleasantly surprised me, the game literally captivates you from the very first minutes and makes you spend as much time as possible in it, wanting to see the ending. After each chapter, there are animated inserts that complement the plot and this is very cool. In each chapter, the story slowly unfolds for you, you meet characters from a past life of main character, some of them helps you, others hinder you. I had a great immersion and that's why I finished the game in the first 7 days.  [h1] Viasuals [/h1] The visual style is so excellent that with every second you can lose the line between the game and reality. I would like to compare this game with Hellblade 2 (may be later I will make a review about it as well), which also had excellent visuals. The only thing is that when Hellblade feels huge, where they cut off a bunch of locations for you, but the world feels empty at the same time. With Wukong, everything is different - the world feels full, every turn looks different, and there is a feeling that there is even a little more content here than I wanted. At the same time, it seems to me - this game has the best optimization on UE5, my game was going great from the very first day and you know what? Personally for me - Wukong is best optimized game at release day, and I think even it’s the best UE5 game.  [h1] Dark Souls vs Black Myth [/h1] Everyone positioned this game with Souls. I thought so too at the very beginning, the game is not the easiest and you understand really fast that you will have a hard times. But then everyone started comparing it to God of War. I will say - Wukong is non of them. Although the game is difficult, it does not spare you, but difficult - in fact difficult bosses can be counted on the fingers. And every time you can't pass the boss - just go back, find an additional turn and explore another location - you definitely find few things that will help you to improve your weapons or armor. So often - if you think you are not able to pass someone, actually you can if you explore a little more of the location. Is this similar to Souls? In my understanding, not quite, but it also does not look much like God of War.  [h1] Conclusion [/h1] Wukong gave me quite more than 40 hours of great gameplay. I enjoyed the game immensely, and considering that - 2024 was not so saturated with games, Wukong is basically the best thing that came out this year. Both in terms of visuals, optimization, and in terms of gameplay. Although the game does not have any outstanding or to great plot, but it is not that horror plot which was in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/n-flanders/recommended/412020/]Metro[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/n-flanders/recommended/750920/]Tomb Raider[/url]. The game is not Souls, but not God of War either, it gives something else, between these games, combining both gameplays and creating something of its own. This is not an ordinary copy-paste, and playing this game you can understand that you are playing Wukong. The game that gives you huge and rich locations, pleasant and warm emotions and the opportunity to immerse yourself in a magnificent world where one monkey can change the world.",3,0.563492059707641602,76561198057068990,46.4,244

2025-02-19 11:51,13.1,推荐,"Many reviews have discussed more details about the game, but I'll keep it short and focus on the most important thing that makes this game realy good as i see it.  The most outstanding thing of the game is its unique combat system, which makes every boss fight feel so EPIC, the variety of combat moves is beautiful since you have to use all these moves throughout the long fight against bosses.  You truly experience the fight as if you were in a martial arts movie, like you're playing the Ip Man role but with staff, or like you're playing a instrument while flying through the air, or performing a hard dance with many movements without making a single mistake, this is what realy immerses you in the combat.  Imo... this game is built on the core concept of Sekiro, but way better, Why? cus Sekiro lacks true combat variety, ur level doesn’t really help unless you memorize the boss's moves exactly, this means the game is primarily based on muscle memory, making all skill upgrades and items practically mostly useless if you haven’t memorized the boss’s moves.  I completed Sekiro without using a single item because they were ineffective.. why? because it’s not gonna help if you don’t adapt to the boss’s moves, and when u do then u dont really need it :). and almost the same thing with skills ""tho it not rly a skills"" u get from spending leveling points.  Wukong on the other hand is entirely different, leveling up unlocks new combat dimensions by allowing you to learn a new moves and abilities, making progression actually useful for strengthening yourself and using items effectively so you can freely go back and forth in a boss fight by using many moves and skills u've learned, making ur items actually useful too  For example, in Sekiro when you start a fight with a new boss, you say: ""All I need is to keep trying over and over until I memorize all his moves then I'll defeat him."" But with Wukong you wil say: ""I'll try to use all the skills and moves I've learned.. and with my dodging experience I'll try to defeat him before I even need to memorize his moves.""  This is the one true thing u should consider about what makes this game really good if you are thinking about playing it.",2,0.513095855712890625,76561197968634862,74.9,211

2025-01-13 04:18,53.2,不推荐,"Overrated and not worth even the half price. There are many reviews  which describe the good side of this game like visuals so I won't be talking about that but instead I'll focus on the negatives:  - Level design - it looks like devs were inspired by Mortal Shell first area. The locations are huge and everything looks exactly the same. Like after couple of crossroads you can only guess if you already visited this place. Considering the size of the map the exporation feels like a puking experience. Also the map is populated with regular enemies which require you to just mash the attack button to pass through them. The exploration is maybe the most enjoyable aspect of souls-like games but this game almost made me quit because of boredom. Yeah, and fameous invisible walls all over the map, how could I forget about them.  - The movement and combat feels clunky and unresponsive. There were a lot of situations where I've pressed the roll/estus button but the character just does not do anything. And the combat - it takes significant amount of time for the monkey to execute a charged heavy attack and the bosses can do whatever they want while you are spinning in the air. There are so many options to interrupt your charged attack - enemy can jump to the other side of arena, freeze you in the middle of the animation, break your attack with counter-attack, I even had a situation where the cutscene interrapeted the attack lol. And of couse my favorite one - it's when the enemy is standing right in front of you and the hit just missed for whatever ****ing reason even though the enemy and the weapon models definetly collided. What a compelling gameplay.  - Quests. It looks like devs were inspired by Miyazaki style so for the most part you have to use a guide to figure out what to do. [spoiler]Even such important thing as as main hub requires to complete a questline which is very easy to miss. Also in chapter 4 you have to follow a specific boss order because if you visit bosses in different order then one of them will be unavailable until NG+. This is ridiculous.[/spoiler]  - Boss design. It looks like bosses were designed by two different dev teams because 90% of bosses are extremely easy and the others are ridiculously hard to the point of absurdity. Now when I fight this dude with vagina on his forehead I remember General Radahn was actually such a good guy.  So the lesson I've learned is that if you see a review-bombed chinese game then divide it's rating by two.",3,0.510087013244628906,76561198240512732,61.5,0

2025-01-29 02:16,43.5,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong is undoubtedly a visual masterpiece. The graphics are at the forefront of the game’s appeal, showcasing some of the best technical achievements in the industry. However, as incredible as the game looks, there’s more to a game than its visuals, and Black Myth: Wukong has its share of shortcomings.  One major issue is that the game often feels more like a tech demo than a fully realized experience. It’s reminiscent of those Unreal Engine 5 showcases that highlight the engine’s capabilities but lack the depth of a fleshed-out game world. The environments, while gorgeous, sometimes feel empty and lacking in meaningful interactions or exploration. Additionally, the hyper-realistic design can be misleading; there are moments where the terrain—like a cave, a wall with a small hole, or a rock formation—looks traversable, only for you to hit an invisible wall. These moments break immersion and remind you that, despite the game’s beauty, it has rigid limitations.  The story is another area where the game stumbles, especially for players unfamiliar with the book ""Journey to the West"" or the Chinese mythology and cultural context the game is steeped in. Cutscenes are visually stunning but can be confusing, leaving players who aren’t versed in the source material feeling lost. At times, it felt like I was just running around killing things without a clear understanding of why. The game doesn’t make much effort to bridge the gap for those who lack prior knowledge of the story, which detracts from the overall narrative experience.  On the other hand, the boss fights are a definite highlight. Most of them are well-designed, challenging, and fun to play, though there are one or two that feel a bit unfair. Still, these encounters stand out as some of the game’s most memorable moments.  It’s also worth noting that Black Myth: Wukong is best experienced on a high-end PC. The game’s greatest strength lies in its visuals—its breathtaking landscapes and meticulously crafted scenery. Without the hardware to fully appreciate this, the experience might feel lackluster.  Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is an impressive game with clear strengths and weaknesses. While its graphics and boss battles shine, the lack of depth in exploration, occasional immersion-breaking design, and inaccessible storytelling hold it back. Despite these flaws, it’s undeniably a strong contender for Game of the Year and an experience worth checking out—if your PC can handle it.",2,0.506587207317352295,76561198118855467,44.0,149

2024-10-08 10:51,52.5,推荐,"Having finally beaten the game I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the best new games this year.   The combat is great. At the start of the game it's easy to get fooled into thinking the combat doesn't have much variety, but the further into the game you get, the more items you unlock, the more you level up, the more the combat system really comes together. You can change your weapon stance to switch between different heavy attacks and other combos, you have a lot of different spells that can completely change the way you approach combat, and there are several transformations that change your moveset entirely. You can even customize your healing in multiple ways, which is a really nice addition. By the end of the game I had several different ""builds"" I could switch between depending on the situation, which is helped by the fact that the game lets you respec all your upgrades for free at any time, which is something more games should do.  The game's difficulty is at a pretty fair level. It is much easier than a lot of the games it gets compared to, like Dark Souls or Sekiro, but it has some boss fights that are challenging even to a veteran of the genre. Don't come into this game expecting to overcome anything like you do in Sekiro, but expect to be pushed harder than your average action game. I have not explored a lot of the side content yet, but the few optional bosses I encountered were the hardest fights in the game. I saw some people complaining about the final boss being too hard, but I thought it was easily the game's best fight and is the perfect difficulty level.  Graphics are not very important to me when it comes to how much I like a game, so all I'll say about Wukong's graphics is that they are among the best I've ever seen. Not enough to affect my opinion on the gameplay, but very good and is surprisingly well optimized considering that this is the studio's first AAA game. I was even able to get it running fairly well on steam deck, but I would not really recommend playing it on there if you are wanting to play at 60fps or graphics are important to you. Only bringing that up to say how well the devs did at optimizing the game especially considering it's in Unreal 5.",2,0.50594031810760498,76561199083532743,55.6,0

I would give it a middle review if I could.  It is visually stunning, the areas look magnificent to say the least. The cutscenes and boss intros are fantastic. But the problems come when you are actually playing the game.  Exploration is abysmal. The first act's map is okay, lots of invisible walls arbitrarily blocking you, but not too many winding paths. Not really anything interesting either, though. The second act, however, is a mess. The map intersects with itself everywhere, you can run around in circles for a while and still miss things because they're placed in awkward spots constantly. There is no ""flow"" to exploring the map; items, bosses, and enemies feel arbitrarily plopped down where they are almost always. Can't speak for anything past there, because that's where I dropped the game, but I've heard it's much the same if not worse going forward.  Then we have the combat. This game's combat is okay. It's not good, definitely the worst of any Soulslike game I've ever played, also definitely worse than God of War's (which I see it compared to frequently, though I don't really see it. More of a Souls game). There are two main functions, hit and dodge. That's it. You can learn some other techniques throughout the game that give it ever so slightly more depth, but you will spend most of your time in every boss fight spamming dodge and attack. The bosses don't have interesting interactions with different abilities like FromSoft titles (because there are no interesting abilities), they don't have certain moves you can parry (because there is no parry), they don't really do anything except swing at you with a different cadence than the last enemy you fought.  Combined with possibly one of the most forgiving dodges of any game ever, this leads to a game that is painfully easy and one-dimensional, in a genre that typically relies heavily on the difficulty and intricacy of its combat to remain engaging. You don't get that addictive sensation of learning or improving while playing. Up to and including the tiger boss in act 2, I think there were 2 enemies that took me more than 5 attempts to defeat. Most bosses I dropped on my literal first attempt, with zero knowledge of their moveset at all. It's a shame, because they have some great introductions, only to be complete pushovers.  The skill tree also feels unnecessarily bloated. It works on a similar gain XP > redeem a skill system as God of War or Sekiro, but unlike those games, most of these upgrades just feel... boring. Like they're only there to give you something to work towards and nothing else. A little more health, a little more stamina, blocking a few more abilities with a certain move, etc.  Despite how much I've been slogging on it, I still think it's a decent game. Just one of if not the weakest among its competition. If you are simply starving for third-person combat games, especially Soulslike titles, it's still worth trying out. Particularly if the difficulty of FromSoft game are usually daunting to you, though I don't know why you would even be looking at the genre if so. Maybe wait for a big sale.   6.5/10",20,0.55368494987487793,76561197971175252,8.4,541

2024-11-15 20:02,41.2,推荐,"An absolutely incredible experience; I've not played a game in a very long time with this much production value, excellent combat and adventure combined. I strongly recommend picking up Black Myth if you want a game with combat which is as engaging as say Dark Souls, but without most of the baggage that comes along with those games.  Black Myth puts a much stronger focus on boss design and story on top of having a snappy and diverse combat system. Although challenging, it does not punish dying, making it much more approachable to new players than your standard Soulsborne game. I feel like the game has the perfect level of difficulty, unlike Shadow of the Erdtree which was abhorrent with artificial difficulty in boss design.  The voice acting, story, writing, pacing and characters are all top-notch. There is excellent enemy variety and lots to find thanks to it's cleverly designed branching linear level design. Not quite open world, but a nice balance of not feeling completely lost but also knowing roughly where to go next!  Item and build upgrades feel very impactful, and the RPG mechanics are present in full force despite the game being substantially story focused; there's enough variety in the different move-sets and being able to re-spec and change your play-style so things don't feel too stale.  I have a few areas of improvement, some of these are technical, but they absolutely do not detract much from the overall experience:  - Invisible walls and extremely limited platforming: The landscapes have an incredible amount of detail in them, often it looks like I should be able to climb or explore somewhere only to find it's blocked off by invisible barriers. Not a huge problem, but it doesn't seem like a limitation we should be having in 2024.  - Action queuing isn't very good: Often whilst in combat, healing or trying to charge up my heavy attack requires pressing the respective buttons twice. Sometimes they queue right away after another action, so I might end up performing those actions twice without meaning to.  - Respeccing easily may reduce replay value and trivialise some fights: Some may consider this an accessibility feature, I do think respeccing should be allowed, but being able to do it an unlimited amount of times means players can cheese fights more easily. The ability to completely change your build so easily (at least for me) hinders replay value in the long run. It's a good thing, NG+ is present!  Overall, this is an excellent first game for a new developer and definitely a contender for GOTY!",2,0.503577709197998047,76561197995944207,41.8,0

2025-01-14 01:09,21.5,不推荐,"I give this a lukewarm thumbs up and would recommend it on sale. It will be negative so it shines in the sea of blind praise. This game has issues. Lots of them.  This game lacks some of the finer points that makes a good action game / souls like. After trying multiple builds I ended up defaulting to smash stance and spamming light attack combos. While well presented and very pretty lacks serious mechanical depth that you would find in one of it's contemporaries like Lies of P. The world is very pretty but that vanishes  when you realize it is a series of boxes and corridors with no real exploration. There are secrets but I never felt the incentive to find them because the world is littered with invisible walls that prevent any real free form exploration. Invisible walls that are missing from VERY PARTICULAR areas of the map just to induce the ""git gud/ prepare to die"" ebic hardness that us souls gamers are looking for, amirite? In reality falling off cliffs is not fun when you cant always do it, you can fall off certain cliffs for one particular bullshit death. Its emblematic of the whole experience. There are gates here and a very particular sequence that the Devs want you to have but those cool moments are broken up by bouts of tedium and frustrating level design. I was never going to review this game but after experiencing the pagoda realm it was evident that this game is more imitation than genuine red meat. That level in particular shows that they took all the wrong lessons from Blighttown, Shrine of Amana, the Londor Ramparts, and many many other ""swamps"" in the genre. The levels feel like they have the same charm and attention put into them like any other souls like but when actually interacting with them it strikes as shallow much like the combat system. Game is cheap when it wants to kill you and fair to the point of being boring when the chips are down. If the game was a series of cutscenes and bossfights without the very mid level sections inbetween it would be alot better.",2,0.50312960147857666,76561198035695603,25.2,445

2025-01-19 03:03,71.8,推荐,"TLDR: 8/10 A GOW-like fun action game with a fantastic final fight. Confusing story if you don't know Journey to the west. Best experienced with a high tier gaming rig to get the best graphical experience, otherwise it's rough.  MINOR SPOILERS BELOW MINOR SPOILERS BELOW MINOR SPOILERS BELOW MINOR SPOILERS BELOW  My experience was used with this PC setup:  AMD Ryzen 7800 RTX 4070 super 32 GB Ram Monitor: 2560 x 1440, 165 Hz Performance: 9/10 Using recommended settings, I can clear a consistent 90-100 FPS (all very high, medium ray tracing, 75 super resolution) with frame gen ON. Raising it to cinematic drops to to anywhere between 55-84 depending on area. Oddly, some cutscenes (particularly in act 5) experience significant frame drops and stuttering. Not sure why this is, but keeping the game in recommended settings removed this issue completely. Act 6 (the msot graphically intense setting) on cinematic was not possible for my setup- it would drop anywhere between 16-25 frames. On recommended, this was a non-issue.  Graphics: 9.5/10 The game's gorgeous: lighting and clothing textures are some of the best I've ever seen. Playing in higher graphical settings appeared to create some strange phantom effects and blurring during movement, but this generally went unnoticed if I wasn't looking for it. Under a microscope, there are some minor graphical cuts here and there, but the game generally looks good where it matters  Gameplay: 6/10 As a soulsborne vet who's played all the games (except demon's souls), this is the thing I most looked forward to the most. Fighting is mostly satisfying, but can take some getting used to. Landing a massive heavy attack is immensely satisfying, and with enough talent points, combat begins to flow much more smoothly. Some combat mechanical jank in terms of responsiveness in when a dodge or combo move is pressed: I can't count the number of times where the game entirely ignored my input and either didn't dodge or didn't combo properly. More personal opinion: making the penultimate move take the longest time in exchange for making it build the most focus is an odd choice. I think it may have been better as an extra move or a stance specific attack. Raw heavy attack in smash stance is waaayyyyy too slow. It's clear  that there was more time spent in the flair than actually making it feel good. On that note, bosses and enemies have some odd inconsistencies. In terms of difficulty, they tend to either be piss easy, or absurdly challenge. The only memorably difficult bosses are the thousand eyed daoist, red boy, and the final boss. Both the daoist and red boy (first phase) are difficult because their animations genuinely confound and confuse rather than being mechanically complex. There's a lot of extra movement, which, looks great in making the character feel alive, but for combat it can make learning what's just animation and what's an attack harder than necessary. I personally found it highly frustrating; moreso when an attack would seemingly come without ANY pre-animation to indicate it. Worse than that, some attacks are clearly missing frames between when they're launched and the final active hit box exists, making reactions even harder. This may be a result of the game being rendered in unreal 5, as I'm beginning to find this to be a common issue, but it's still very frustrating.  The good news? Most of these issues are absent from the final boss. It is mechanically, thematically, and visually, ABSOLUTE CINEMA and one of the greatest fights of any game I have ever played: 10/10  no notes.  There are many obscure secrets in the game that give extra powers and unlocks, and while I was able to find a few there appear to be far too few hints as to how to actually solve them. Often, I completed them completely by accident.  Story: 8/10 Edit: I'm raising the score to an 8/10. The story is great, but for me was hard to follow unless I had was playing in my native language. A big part of the story for every section is hard to understand if you don't unlock all the secrets which leads to confusion.  Overall: 8/10. I would play it again . Listen to the story in your own language and you'll probably understand it better. Combat can have some instances of frustration, but is mostly good if a little too easy most of the time. Graphically the game is beautiful. The final boss fight is the best part of the game: as it should be. Edit: I replayed it for NG+ and revised the rating after completing the hidden bosses.

2024-12-22 09:47,56.7,不推荐,"I cannot, at all, give this game a positive rating, nor do I wish to give it a negative rating.  Steam not having a very middle of the road opinion is annoying, but here we are.  Wukong, as a story, is honestly incredibly good.  It's one story, with several chapters of mini stories that weave into the overall plot.  They all take on a very unique story, given this is a Chinese story, including themes, deities, folklore, myths and legends that just don't get enough widespread attention.  The characters in the story are believable, some are funny, some you love to hate, others you are sad along with them.  The various zones all feel unique, with their own environmental touches to go with them.  Deserts feel like desert, the snow lands the same.  The game is beautiful to look at, with combat being flashy and punch to add to the visuals.  The characters look amazing, and while the lips don't sync with english I can get over that.  The combat is where I struggle to actually approve this game.  The game is difficult, but also wildly easy at points as well.  Some combat challenges are rightfully difficult, where you feel good about beating.  Others simply are a chore.  The few are just badly designed fights, where the dodge mechanic simply does not work despite you fully timing the dodge correctly.  Not to mention you have no block button, and while some are going to immediately state the stone spell, or the fact you don't need a block, doesn't take away from the fact that you can't block attacks regularly.  Instead, you have to dodge, most of the time works, and randomly gets you killed.  The amount of secrets I can appreciate, but there is a lot of back tracking to find old secrets, and really I recommend not playing this game blind unless you wish to play it more than once.  There is a lot of content you can just skip without knowing it, or be in the middle of doing, fail to do one single thing and the quest is completely shut off from you now.  Why would anyone design a game like that?  Some of us don't want to play New Game +, as I do not want to go through this game a second time.  Overall, it's just so middle of the road that I refuse to give it a thumbs up.  So much drags it down, yet so much props it up the balance keeps it in the middle.  However, if these people make a Godzilla game then absolutely take my money.",1,0.501420378684997559,76561198078815949,56.7,0

2025-03-13 10:35,54.9,推荐,"Honestly one of if not the best games China has made to the open market of the world and they are not shying away from telling you. The story of this game made me read the very very long Sun Wukong book with its historically interesting views on China's 16th century politics and general sentiments of people living in that time.   This game has text's for every single enemy you defeat and its told in historical allegories which are very interesting if you choose to engage with it ( i recommend it since it gives the world flavor and the enemies that live in the story). The gameplay is similar to a mix of action that i akin to games like God of War mixed with dodge mechanics and precise button presses similar to that of elden ring or souls-like games. The true gem of the game is the storyline and overall world building that they have managed to create from the sun wukong texts. Don't get me wrong the gameplay feels crisp and polished, nothing like perfectly dodging huge attacks and then being rewarded with your own huge SMASHING hit on the enemy with your cudgel. Surprisingly the more i played this game the more I realized how much side content and hidden things there are to discover when playing. There is whole weapon playstyles that are fleshed out like building a character to be focused around certain ailments such as poison or elements like lightning. Honestly if you are looking to do every single boss or secret this game will easily take you over 80 hours of gameplay. The protagonist is..lets say forgetable as in he has little to zero lines and acts just as a stand in for the iconic trickster moneky Sun Wukong but the spotlight is put on the side characters that you encounter and the stories of their fall from graces of celestial heaven.   I have tried to complete this game twice and I have failed to do so just because im picky and want to do all the side quests and realize the power fantasy of receiving and crafting the gear that is very powerful. In that pursuit im also lost in many places trying to figure out where the developers hid these secrets and in that regard its a bit tedious and kinda burnt me out after realizing i missed some things that are ENTIRELY chanced upon. The map in some places are beyond confusing so much so that they released a patch to even have a MAP of the area and im still getting turned around and lost as how to access portions of it. Overall a great game with great combat and a extremely interesting and engaging fantasy world to learn about mixed with real historical allegories of China and Chinese culture.

Incredible hard work has been dedicated for this game to run the way it does. the game is also VERY FORGIVING. if u spent the wrong points? get it back. if u crafted the wrong item? get a refund. but if you bought the wrong item, LOL too bad !   the game gives you unlimited lives and tries to perfect your craft. the vast amount of skill point modification alongside an arsenal of different gears to mix and match with is an art in itself.   i dont really write much reviews, nor do i buy games at TODAYS PRICE without discounts. But this game? i happily paid full and would do it over and over again.   what captivated me the most: the exceptional visuals, sounds and cutscenes. the seemless gameplay and just overall mechanics was a resounding 5 stars for me.   thank you devs for introducing some of the chinese mythical stories for all to see. it is by far the best experience ive had with a game in a very very very long while.

Boss fights are a brutal test of skill and patience—think Dark Souls on a bad day—where every victory feels like pure euphoria.

It is not a game trying to copy-paste from other game. It is its OWN game, with its own style, which is why it really deserve GOTY of 2024 (and yet failed to get it).  [Bad] 1. Performance optimization is an issue for this game. I got a 4090 and still ran into frame drop. Mid-range PC probably will get 60 FPS with frame-gen ON. 2. When frame-gen is ON, you will find very-hard to perform a PERFECT dodge. The dodge delay is significant (caused by frame-gen).  3. Erlang can beat your ass for couple of hours, or days. Erlang is a well-designed boss in terms of background, visual and storyline. However, me personally do not find the fight and combat with Erlang to be fun. Without a ""PROPER SETUP"", you will find very constantly discouraging when facing Erlang's parry-bar. I do beat him in a couple of trys, as a Souls-like game veteran. However, I believe many players will be struggling with him without looking up ""How-to-beat him"" online.

The graphics, atmosphere, mythology/story is top-notch; very immersive! And combat and mechanics is flawless.   Anyway, I bought this game because I love the time and setting this is set—Tang dynasty. I love traveling to explore the remnants of the past in natural landscapes and this game reflects that. Many of the grottoes and rock carvings in the game I've been to, so its quite fascinating. I wish they had condensed the game more, as many of the same carvings were copy and pasted repeatedly throughout the game. Rather than using these as mere backdrops, it would've been good if more significance were given to them by working them into the story and lore, as these are real places that can actually be visited in China today.  A couple improvements that would've polished the game to perfection:  1. the beginnings of the game is great, even ordinary low-level npc will make unique comments about you and the story line, making it very immersive. However, towards the middle of the story this is gone, and the end chapter is just a big empty landscape which feels like they ran out of time in making the game. I'm a quality over quantity kind of person, so I wish they had condensed the game by shortening the chapters or reduce a couple chapter to spend more time on details. They could also have reduced the number of bosses and spirits, as when you have too many, they start to dilute the uniqueness and memorability of the characters in the game. Sometimes when you have budget and time constraints in a project, you just have to cut out a bunch of stuff and preserve just the gems; and this is not a bad thing; though you do need to factor in the time to link those loose gems into a complete and coherent story.  2. Perhaps they should make the story more accessible to Western audiences by creating a standalone game story rather than being too dependent on the novel. I bet most people who play the game don't even know what's going on, and many npc characters don't even make sense, unless they have good knowledge of the novel and bothered reading the codex/journal.",0,0.5,76561198290117737,121.2,0

The story is confusing, but it ties in so nicely with Journey to the West and is one of the most accurate lore games that I have ever played.  The combat is alone what makes you stick around, not with the smaller enemies between the bosses but the fact that each boss you fight in this game is unique and varies their moves and combos just makes everything feel fun. And unlike some other of these styles of games, none of those bosses get the demotion from boss to regular guy, so it makes them actually stick out in your mind.   The only issues I had with this game were with the 100% and the flowers respawning with a 30 minute IRL timer, it's not the worst. Just tedious at its best.  One of the best games I have played this year and recommend it to anyone looking for a new challenging action RPG.",0,0.5,76561198063564811,66.1,460

Which I do. When going into a new area the audio tends to cut in and out. This happens mostly in cutscenes, which is unfortunate because it interrupts the storytelling but I've noticed that is only happens when going from one place to another via cutscene so it doesn't bother me THAT much.

I spent a while trying to decide whether to try this or not however the more I looked into it the more I was drawn to it.  After seeing all the positive feedback I decided to take the plunge, and lets just say I do not regret it one bit!  At first it did take some getting use to and I died.. a lot, however, once you get the mechanics down and find the abilities that work for you the fights can be epic. There were a couple of boss fights (Yellowbrow & Erlang) where I almost thought it wasn't possible. After getting close to giving up I found learning each bosses patterns is the key and once you do finally defeat them, it really does feel like a true accomplishment.  I'm currently on my 4th playthrough and I'm still finding myself wanting to play more. The story, music and gameplay are all top tier and I'm yet to find a game to rival this.

The game play and combat are amazing.   My downsides on it is fighting bosses every 10-15 minutes.  Although there is a LOT to explore I do like taking more time to do that and this game is a bit of a boss rush.  I also wish there was an upgrade option for your weapons and that the materials to upgrade armors were more available.  I like that they included appearance changes to armors upgraded to Mythical but I wish they would have done it to every armor set, even if it would be small appearance changes on every upgrade until you get to mythical.  These gripes don't affect the game play though.  This game is a 9.5/10 for me.  I really hope they put out a DLC.",0,0.5,76561199820334119,128.6,0

If these style games want to work they need to incorporate a real story behind the boss’s. I know I know it’s great and amazing combat easier than others but it’s just missing that direction to go. It’s just kind of like drop in and figure out what to do online. That is fun but it takes away from my fun to be trying to beat a boss or check optional reroll points and go back at it again.

Once you learn the moves and create a build that takes advantage of a bosses weakness, there is no better feeling.   Elder Jinchi is still my favorite boss.",0,0.5,76561198230209456,120.9,119

I've finished elden ring shadow of erdtree which I find way more difficult than wukong but also more enjoyable. Wukong is just unfair. Combat mechanics are weird. Some sort of soulslike wannabe, I don't know how to describe it. When I lost to a boss fight in elden ring, I was mad because it was my fault and I knew that with a bit more attention I could defeat the boss.

2025-02-15 17:13,135.4,推荐,"In general, the game left positive emotions, but a certain residue of incompleteness was observed throughout the entire game, namely, the history of the characters - they are not fully revealed, but only superficially. Mechanics are both good and bad at the same time. It seems that there is an implementation of combo attacks, but they are so strangely and even absurdly assembled into a single chain that what is created is not a single continuous series of attacks, but individual techniques that simply do not combine with each other.The parry system is a completely different story, if you stand in relation to the enemy from the right and left sides - then for the parry to work - the blow must be brutal in relation to the enemy, and not the character, but here the damage first hits you and only then is it completed by the enemy. Stances are generally poorly implemented in conditions of a quick fight... except for the rotation of the pole from flying projectiles. Don’t you think it’s funny to go through 3 times to get the final stance for 1 minute?) The price is still a little high, maximum $20. And yet, despite all the disadvantages of this game, I think for such a large-scale project this is a good attempt to enter the arena of triple A projects.",0,0.5,76561198082546274,135.4,53

I suffered numerous crashes on PC (the PlayStation 5 version wasn't made available for this review), despite having a top-of-the-line setup with a GeForce RTX 4090, not to mention the multiple times I fell through the ground and died just as I was on the verge of defeating a particularly tough boss, or the way characters would randomly switch from English to Chinese, or the way the dialogue audio would drop out all together and leave me completely in the dark during an important cutscene.

The build diversity is good, ranging from spell-based ""stunlocks"" and ""magic combos"", to traditional pure attack/parry/dodge style of fighting. Action is fast paced and unlike games like Soulslikes (which I don't think BM:W is -- it's not really a ""Soulslike""), you get to really push your own tempo and can approaching things aggressively instead of just doing the ""read and react"" type of grounded gameplay of similar games. There are over 100 boss fights in a 35-50 hour game so it's a real boss-apalooza.   The graphics are absolutely beautiful and the spectacle of many of the cutscenes are great. The end of chapter videos are superbly done.  The only stumble, IMO, is the final chapter, which is so obviously unfinished I'm surprised it launched in that state. However, that doesn't take away from the other 90% of the game before it so it was fine to just sprint through it and be done, to get to the final boss and secret ending bosses (who were great).  It should be said that the story is very difficult to follow if you don't have familiarity with the Journey to the West source material. There are a very large number of references and appearances of characters the lore from the novel.

There are lots of bosses, the combat is fun and the scenery is quite beautiful. I really liked the animations at the end of each chapter, they were amazingly animated and interesting. Baiji is quite a fun character, made me laugh a couple times and overall the games lore and characters are deep and nuanced due to being an adaptation of Journey to the West.   Now I'm going to complain. (Spoilers below, kinda)  I have a relatively modern system, with a 1660 Ti GPU and i7-9750H CPU however this game has just been horribly optimised. Anything under the top of the line hardware won't deliver the beautiful graphics that Wukong seems to be known and praised for. I was still able to enjoy beautiful scenery, but rarely. The majority of the gameplay, especially the start is constantly blurry and my system can only really handle low/med graphics. The lighting is also absolutely horrible for this game, it's just glaring all the time and switches between shadow and light are jarring, especially in chapter 3, you just have to ignore all the surroundings when moving anywhere. There was also a bunch of micro stutters/freezes during combat. Swinging your staff/weapon does this weird sort of after image / screen tear.  I don't really like their combat and leveling system, there's basically zero incentive to switch stances since you can save points and level up elsewhere. The spells were also quite limited and a bit boring after a while, two are just buffs, immobilise is fun but gets old, and I guess rock was my favourite since it provides a simple parry mechanic. Transformations had a bit more variety, but made combat feel more clunky, and I rarely used them because of the cooldown and how much points you need to invest in them.   Invisible walls absolutely everywhere, quite jarring and immersion breaking, just annoying, natural barriers would've been much better.  Chapter 6 was open world, but it was a poor choice, there's just a bunch of open land that chews up time and is pointless to explore.  Personal preference but, there's a ton of weapons locked behind NG+, I rarely do NG+ for games so bit annoying that I couldn't use these.  Mute protagonist, Baiji makes up for this, but it would've been even more entertaining to play as Sun Wukong.  Kind of criticism, idk. From a gameplay aspect this game is not very original, but even for the most basic things. Like the narrow interactive entrances to squeeze through (tomb raider, etc.) ?why?, The chests (seemingly God of war) , the meditation points (ghost of tsushima) and they choose the worst most uninteresting angles to show off@!! Convoluted npcs and questlines (dark souls, etc.), loong scales are so well hidden, you need a guide to find (or maybe an NPC says something, but still).",0,0.5,76561198305974734,47.3,108

I wouldn't call this game a souls like as some have, more of an action adventure like God of War with some souls elements to it. The game is challenging for sure, but the combat is fair.  No spoilers, but there are a couple side quests that you can miss if you don't do things in the right order. If you want to do it all in one play-through you'll have to be really good about exploring or look up a guide that tells you what you might miss.",0,0.5,76561197991438312,65.7,0
2025-01-26 09:35,17.0,推荐,"A good title for starting the Soulsborne Genre. Its not too easy while not being incredibly hard either. The Perfect balance between Combat and Storytelling. However, like most games its got its issues. For instance as someone who plays on controller I noticed there was a bit of an input lag on certain encounters, or sometimes the game doing actions on its own. If you're on controller like me, keep in mind that there will occasionally be heavy input lag on certain actions. Though for the most part it plays smoothly, gameplay like most games has some stutter but otherwise smooth.",0,0.5,76561198087969277,49.5,0

2025-01-25 23:14,122.1,推荐,"Even though the quality of the game can be very inconsistent at times the highs are still some of the most cathartic experiences you'll find in gaming with a shockingly decent combat system + an impressive yet unimpressive roster of bosses   Combat  Wukong's combat is definitely one of if not THE selling point of the game with a plethora of different ways of engaging enemies and bosses in turn shooting up its replayability. The way the three stances are incorporated here also feels very fleshed out (unlike Nioh) adding a ton of variety to the overall combat. Depending on the skill level of the player it can be the jankiest thing on the planet or it can be ridiculously snappy and responsive. But all of that means absolutely nothing if the enemy design doesn't live up to the system since it IS reaction focused after all. Well does it?  Bosses  The quality of the bosses here is infuriatingly inconsistent. You'll find some of the best fights ever made with competently designed movesets that will make your jaw drop to the floor and then you'll be forced to sit through literal fodders with boss hp or cinematic slop for HOURS at a time. The amount of mediocrity present here is what holds me back from flat out saying ""yeah the bosses are good"" which irks me a bit because this game has some of my all time favorite fights even though they're in the minority  Level Design  This is straight up the weakest aspect of the game with literal Team Ninja esque level design for the most part. Navigating through all the convoluted mess of levels without a guide is a literal waste of time and effort since everything quite literally looks exactly the same with pissant weak fodders randomly placed here and there. Chapter 6 was the nail in the coffin for me, they quite literally gave up and made Elden Ring without the legacy dungeons lol  Balancing   This game has some major balancing issues. The difficulty of the game can easily be diluted through the plethora of ridiculously cheesy builds or by straight up overleveling the bosses to hell and back. Whoever claims this game isn't a soulslike is straight up delusional because like every other soulslikes out there Wukong also falls into the same exact trap  Presentation  A huge chunk of the budget went into the presentation of the story alone and it shows. There are a ridiculous amount of cutscenes and every single chapter ends with a traditionally animated short film. With all this emphasis on the game constantly trying to be cinematic I can't blame people for thinking this is a movie game but that really doesn't do the game justice because the amount of mechanical depth present here is genuinely impressive   I can only recommend this game to you if you have the patience to sit through hours of mediocrity to get to those really good bits that make you go ""Worth it""",0,0.5,76561198117751409,122.1,49

Or that if it did ever come out, it could never look anything like th epreviews. Im happy to say for once the game was exactly as good as it looked. It may not be the best action game I've ever played, but its up there. And the visuals and fight choreo on display are truly secondf to none. No matter how insane the action on screen got, for the most part, I always felt in control in the best possible way. The game lacks a bit of depth in terms of build variety, but there are a decent amount of options to find a preferred playstyle. The story was completely indecipherable to me. It felt like watching a foreign film and just appreciating the visuals cuz the dialogue makes no sense.   I am VERY excited to see the next game this team makes.

Game has amazing soundtrack and the combat gameplay feels amazing with a wide variety of options. Being able to restore your points and change our build anytime is a differential, coming from an Soulslike background, I think this adds a lot more fun into the gameplay and was a good decision.  The only things that were a bit of a turnoff, were that the maps seem too confusing, and you can easily get lost on them. I got lost on chapter 2, kept fighting enemies that were on my way, and ended up being overleveled for the rest of the playthrough, which lowered it's difficulty for me. The other thing that bothered me is that some bosses seem to be too difficult for the area they are in. You have and easy time with all bosses until a specific one takes you 10-15 attempts to beat, out of nowhere. The level design seems to be a bit unsynchronized. Also have to mention that some items have a very low % chance of dropping, so you need to farm dozens of plants, and they take 30min of real time to respawn. Farming items from enemies is similarly boring, but you can get items that increase drop rates, buit this last one was for the    100% run only.  Another thing that I need to mention is that it lags a lot, even setting the graphics to low. My PC was able to play Cyberpunk and Elden Ring with minimal lags, but this game lagged too much.A lot of the cutscenes were lagging, having audio but trapped on the same screen, or playing out with the audio delayed. If they optimize the lags, it's a 9/10.

2025-01-19 03:40,81.8,推荐,"So, I tried Dark Souls, can't remember which one but probably the first one years ago when it first came out. Could've even been Demon's Souls for that matter. I died then about ten times to the first boss that appeared and thought: What kind of an idiot wants to play something like this. What kind of a sick individual takes pleasure in dying over and over and over again. The notion remained for years all the way up until Elden Ring (I will be comparing these 2  lot since they are the 2 major sould like games I've played) arrived. I saw some video's, it looked damned good. I also saw video's where people where getting mauled by the Tree sentinel and still didn't touch it. Then my kid bought it and completed it and I felt old and like goddamit I need to try this. And since we have a family steam library, I did. And it was terrible. But there was also something very very addictive and almost fun. So with grit I pushed through and managed to complete the game using every possible cheese method that wasn't outright cheating. Barely.  The lo and hold, Black Myth Wukong comes along. And having just finished ER and a couple of souls lights, I was all beefed up like I got this and bought the game for myself. I just managed to complete the ""normal story"" (the alternative ending is maybe too much for me). And in my opinion those ""souls bro's"" that say stuff like BMW was piss easy to me, can go and pleasure themselves. For me, it was not. There was no mimic tear to call in (the pluck of many wasn't nearly as helpful) and there were far less ways to cheese through the harder bosses (which also apparently got amped up with the latest update). And again I died and died all over the place. When the most tries I ended up having in ER which was 26 against Malenia, I had at least a dozen in Wukong that I tried maybe 50 times before finally beating them. And the journey was grueling. I had to take days off to cool down in between and watch numerous YT videos for any possible help. Over leveling my character (which didn't help much since you can't increase your stats and skills as much as in ER) trying to get an edge. At times I was very close to quitting. But in the end I didn't. Because this game is a boatload of fun. The battles felt very hard, but also reasonable and fair. Unlike in other games I could usually see the boss on the screen at all times and see where the attack was coming from. So it was just to learn their moves and get better. I definitely had the best ""git gud"" feeling I've had in these games with this one. Sometimes the lack of a true open world and invisible walls were slightly annoying but then again the story was a lot easier to follow than in ER, in which it was totally cryptic or nonexistent. The visuals are the best I've ever seen in a game. God of War comes close and maybe also ER. The gameplay is excellent. the controls impeccable. This was a lot of fun, but I think I will take a break from these for a while. For now.",0,0.5,76561198079265758,81.8,0

2024-08-24 04:29,11.4,推荐,"So far I love everything about this game. From the story, visuals, gameplay... it's a beautiful game about chinese mythology and a rare gem of 2024. The world and visuals are stunning, although exploration is linear I want to see everything this game has to offer. This is also the first game where I chose not to play in default english, as it sounds so much better in original voice (chinese) and it makes for a more unique experience.  Combat is souls inspired, but difficulty is very forgiving. There is no block/parry button, you only have to dodge attacks at the right time. Also at dying you won't loose anything, but enemies will respawn on dying and resting. This game is not hard as souls-like so noob casuals like me can give this a try. However it can still be challenging and some bosses will make you die over and over again. You can't rush in and mash buttons expecting not to die in a few hits. With that said you may have to adapt your skill points, thankfully respec doesn't cost anything so you have all the freedom to try out different abilities/playstyle.  To summarize, it's an amazing singleplayer game with all the right components- interesting story, great gameplay, amazing visuals and sound effects. Optimization is very good. I can play it on my old pc (i5-7500 and GTX 1060) with a bit of tweaking. Great purchase, fantastic game! 10/10",893,0.946137368679046631,76561198052408879,59.6,1875
2024-08-23 11:55,30.0,推荐,"(Review in progress, 8h so far, 2 chapters completed)  This game surprised me more than I expected. The level of polish and care put into it is quite impressive and I absolutely loved my time with it so far. Graphics and art-design are top notch, sound design is great, music has its highs and lows, but what it doesn't lack is identity, it's pretty original. If you're familiar with the original story or Chinese mythology, you'll probably love the interpretations of characters from there, if you have no idea what is it about, prepare yourself for a wild ride, it can get quite weird, but equally amazing.   Now, the main thing - gameplay. Overall I can say that it's pretty fun and I had a good time with it, especially thanks to the very decent enemy variety and non-stop bosses with their own quirks, but the only gripe that I personally have with the game - is the lack of combos, or just overall depth of core staff combat. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, however it seems like the combat's variety is leaning more towards a couple of special abilities and you waiting for them to be available again, while with the staff itself you have only one light attack combo and with that only 3 variations of heavy attacks, plus you can't cancel out of many of your animations, which is annoying in a game like this. Also most of your character progression is tied to stats improvements. I guess after playing many games like DMC series, Bayonettas, even something like recent GOW, Darksiders etc, I got spoiled with even more responsive and flexible combat systems, but other than that, I'm more than satisfied with everything else.  Can I recommend it? Heck yeah! We need more single-player games like this one. Who is it for? I'd say it's a mix of a Souls-like meets GOW, but it has its own unique ideas as well. Final score (as of now) - 8.5/10  If the game manages to surprise me with something else, I'll be glad to raise the score to at least 9/10, but I'm a bit picky about some gameplay details. Still impressed though.  UPD after 30 hours and almost finishing the game - I'll leave the score at 8.5 and my main points still stand. This game is impressive and it's one of the best and most solid 8/8.5 out of 10 sorta games you'll ever play, but some parts of the game outstay their welcome and combat doesn't evolve much (some people have a different opinion on this, and that's fine by me).

2025-02-20 19:59,79.2,推荐,"Wukong is an excellent game with some minor flaws.   The combat is great, soulslike without being so difficult that I want to bury my controller in the garden. The environments are incredible, and the plot is awesome.  I've clocked 80 hours over two months, which is made up of two full playthroughs and getting every single achievement, bar one minor thing (I'll get to that)   A couple of downsides; 1. And this is the only one that really bothered me - Invisible walls. As I said the level design is great and I want to explore every corner of it, so it really breaks the immersion when I want to go in one direction only to be stopped by an unforeseen barrier.  2. NG+ felt a bit like NG- - I flew through it the second time through beating bosses first try that would have previously taken me 10 attempts  3. This one is probably a more broader issue for completionists in these sort of games. Boring, grindy achievements. After travelling many distant lands, making friends and foes, and fighting a court of gods. I find myself unable to pop the platinum because I can't find one seed. My gameplay will end with me hopping on every hour or so, once the plants have replenished just to hope the RNG gods will let have a fire date seed.

2024-09-28 07:55,104.7,推荐,"[h1]Genre: Action-Adventure/Mythology[/h1]  This game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku.   I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.  The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.  The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.  When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.  The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.  Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.  Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.  In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.  Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.  [h1]Pros:[/h1] - One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen - Incredibly fun combat - Journal entries are so interesting - Cutscenes are amazing - Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses - Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting  [h1]Neutral:[/h1] - Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but it's also really interesting  [h1]Cons:[/h1] - Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses  [h1]Verdict:[/h1] Just an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books and this is definitely one of my new favorite games.

It isn't ""perfect in every way""; but what it does well, it does better than most before it and resets several bars in terms of expectations for games going forward.  Its graphics, its fluidity in movement; its animations; its level design; its bosses...all top-notch.    It is absolutely NOT a souls-like.  It has a few elements of what makes soulslikes great; but leaves out the frustrating parts. It acknowledges that it is already a tough game and doesn't further burden the player with the tedious punishments that some of us souls-like-fatigued have become accustomed to tolerating:  - No hunting down souls dropped - No min/maxing builds based on a subset of weapon types - fewer punishing second-phase fights  May seem like a short list, but the lack of that ""Holy crap, I hate this game...I can't believe I just grinded through this entire level for the past hour only to get one-shotted and lost all my progress"" feeling.  As many other players have noted, this game is far closer to GOW.   My favorite description I read so far was:   ""It's like God Of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Elden Ring had a threesome and nobody knows who the father is.""  Cons (short list):  - invisible walls are especially noticeable in the first chapter.  Annoying to see something that looks like a cave, but hit an invisible wall five feet in front of it. - A noticeable halo effect caused by what appears to be post-processing setting. Toning that down made a good improvement. - some heavy granular effects by what I assume is some graphics setting in either post-processing. - Not sure if the ""FSR"" is FSR3...also, we can't completely turn off the FSR/DLSS apparently...it looks like we can only set it to quality and up the resolution limit to 100%.  It would be nice to be able to turn it off; even if it is only for a comparison.     But aside from those very minor nitpicks, this game is an all-time-top-tier-absolutely fabulous game and I HOPE MAJOR GAME STUDIOS WILL SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS IS AND FOLLOW THEIR LEAD!!!

2024-08-31 11:53,79.6,推荐,"[h1] 9 / 10 [/h1]  [b] For me, this is one of the best games in history! [/b]  This game is proof that a project doesn't need battle passes, paid cosmetics, or in-game shops to be successful. This is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade; the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane.  Starting with one of the top selling points: the graphics. The graphics are absolutely absurd; Unreal Engine 5 is the best-looking engine on the market as of 2024, and this game makes very good use of it. Yes, using UE5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems, although they're minor compared to other UE5 titles released recently.  The combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety-wise. Every single enemy in this game is unique and original, with highly detailed models and movesets; there's only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses. Some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop. The game has a lot of different skills and movesets, transformations, and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter. Although I gotta admit that I wish it had more spells.  The biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map. This game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration, sometimes even on clear paths that look like they'd be explorable otherwise. And this is the reason i'm not giving this game a 10/10.  The soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game; the OSTs are magical and epic. Each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music, with different stories and meanings. For a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game, it's a magical experience for sure...  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in Chinese folklore and mythology. The story is amazing; I was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme, and after playing it, I gotta say I really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories.  I genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history.",452,0.903439998626708984,76561198125547919,79.6,264
2024-09-05 01:11,83.5,推荐,"[h1]Sensational experience[/h1] Black Myth: Wukong was released under a lot of anticipation after gameplay showcases had been shown over the past few years, leading people to even question if the game would really come out like that. Thankfully, it really did – and overcame all expectations. The game is engaging, well made, fluid, has a fair dose of difficulty, is downright beautiful and is worth every penny and time you put into it.  [h1]Story background[/h1] I honestly find it hard to catch up with the story – at least without any knowledge on the classical Chinese novel The Journey To The West, where the developers have taken inspiration from. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the game, especially during a second playthrough.  The game isn’t the classical novel itself, but inspired by it. It’s set after Sun Wukong’s disappearance/death after his fight against the Celestial Court – event that serves as a prologue. You play as a monkey warrior referred to as The Destined One, who journeys through the land to recover Sun Wukong’s six relics, which were scattered across the land, in order to try to bring the famous monkey back to life.  [h1]How does it feel?[/h1] It feels amazing! Black Myth: Wukong is a third person game that you can label under the soulslike banner. However, that doesn’t mean it has an excruciating difficulty. It’s more of a friendly soulslike with some elements of hack and slash – enemies are usually difficult, bosses are challenging, but you won’t lose anything if you die. It might take you some time to beat some bosses, but you eventually end up succeeding. The more you venture into the game, the better you get because you are earned more resources to fight, as well as you get naturally better at playing it. There practically aren’t hordes of enemies like in a hack and slash game, so you won’t be swarmed.  A magical iron staff is your main weapon, but there are also magical skills, transformations, three difference stances, potions to temporarily enhance your abilities and a skill tree to spend your points on according to your playstyle. There won’t be enough points (sparks) to buy all abilities, so be wise and understand what your playstyle is and don’t waste sparks on things you don’t use – although it’s possible to reattribute them.  Among the things that make this game appealing is the fluid combat. It’s not sluggish, floaty and clunky as most soulslike games. The movements are beautiful and fast-paced, satisfying to perform. And the bosses hardly ever have the same movements. They are pretty much all unique, which adds to the game. So you don’t feel you are facing a repetition of a previous boss under new skin, except for the elemental frogs.  [h1]Graphics and details are no joke[/h1] Black Myth: Wukong is a ‘new’ generation game like no other. It features the best and most advanced technologies out there, and applies them very well. It’s not a poorly optimized game – it indeed is a heavy one. But even if you lower the presets, you are still going to have a beautiful game.  The game doesn’t survive on good graphics alone. I could say it’s absolutely one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. The details in the scenarios, the architecture, the clothes, the weapons, with all the rich Chinese ornamentations… how well detailed the enemies are when it comes to appearance, movements, attacks… how varied everything is… You can spend a lot of time just gazing at details, which contributes a lot to your immersion. Well, I could spend all day long listing how incredible the details are. Game Science didn’t have any laziness.  [h1]Flaws[/h1] Of course, there are flaws. The game is so incredible to the point that the flaws aren’t a deal breaker, but they’re so silly they shouldn’t be there.  The most alarming of all are the invisible walls. Wukong is full of them, even at unnecessary places! We’re not talking about a totally linear game – there are areas of (semi) open world. It means there shouldn’t be invisible walls, even inside monk temples where you could walk to the temple wall. But you can’t because there’s another invisible wall before it. When it happens, it breaks the immersion a little bit.  Another grave one is the simply terrible lip sync. That disturbs our enjoyment a lot if we pay attention to it rather than notice other graphical elements. That's why I stopped looking at their mouths and began admiring the rest. They haven't used any AI to lip sync with English, so the English voiceover doesn't match the Chinese lip movements. Embarrassing.  Also, some lighting issues sometimes occur. When you walk into a new area, for instance, you may experience light sources changing, just popping from dark to clear sunlight all of a sudden, like inside some caves or other places in the desert.  I’ve also experienced enemies, NPCs and other elements popping in front of me in the scenarios, less frequently though. Maybe it could have been due to hours of session straight.  At least three or four times, I was forced to close the game and rerun it after some lags and huge fps drops – also after long hours of gameplay straight. You see, I got 32GB RAM, but maybe the game uses it so much that the memories are unable to erase unnecessary information. But, rerunning the game always fixed it.  [h1]Black Myth: Wukong is a must[/h1] It’s not any game that has some flaws yet its strengths eclipse them. The flaws don’t ruin your experience, and you definitely should play this game. Wukong is one of those games you can’t miss and will make you have an unforgettable experience.  Black Myth: Wukong is not groundbreaking, it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but proves that if devs really want to create a game with competence and passion – and above all, a game that is supposed to be what it is: a videogame! –, they deliver wonderful experiences.

Versatility is their Core yet many games in similar ""God-based"" Epic tend to be more human-like ( God of War ) Still on chapter 3 and am already level 54 and 60 is max level ( after reaching level 74 there's no level cap because Gods don't need caps lol ) . This game does everything right I cannot recommend enough. Story is very motivational despite not having to know much in chinese mythology.  This gameplay loop and ease of respec-ing the character at any time without cost are how GODS/Demi Gods should be portrayed. They're All-rounders and they pick & choose every single asset with ""need of application"" in mind. I love how everything has multiple skill-build based attribute.

But what I'm NOT seeing is people actually talking about the game. At least at time of writing. Most people are talking about how good it looks, or how well it plays. Or vice versa. But no one talking about what the game is like. Or how it feels to play it. Is it worth my fricken money???  Well let me help with that. Yes it's worth the money.  It's a souls-like game despite it not having that tag on the steam store page. It plays similar to Jedi Fallen Order or God of War or Darksiders. It's a linear action game where if you die you go back to a resting point. If you rest at said resting point all enemies respawn as does your healing items. However unlike Dark Souls or Elden Ring you don't lose experience points, money or items when you die.  But yes, the production value in this game is off the charts. It looks even more beautiful then it does on the steam store page. It sounds beautiful too. The gameplay is also fun, fluid and engaging. There's so much done right about this game that I hate to talk about whats wrong with it.  For instance the tutorial is severely lacking. Barely teaches you anything.   Or how there's little to no direction in the game. Unless i'm severely missing something. But After the first hour I was absolutely, completely. 100 percent lost. No idea where to go or what to do. The game is lacking in direction in pretty much every single definition of the word and I actually hate that.  But if you can find your own way, don't mind really hard games and don't mind a character with no character or a plot with no plot then this game does everything else 110 percent perfect.  So let that be your deciding factor I guess. I mean 60 dollars is still a lot of money, just know what you're getting into. But if this genre is what you're looking for then it's worth the money.

Great story and a world inspired by Chinese mythology and The Journey to the West.

I fought every boss, meditated in every location, and met all the characters for the journal and I enjoyed the entire experience. Baije was amazing and really added a lot to the Destined One's journey; I think his last few lines of dialogue in the game was my favorite part.

2024-08-22 19:45,25.0,推荐,"The game devs have said many times this is not a souls-like, I corrected people many times to tell them it is not a souls-like. Turns out that yeah, I think it is very much a souls-like.   Right off I think this is going to create a problem for a lot of buyers who likely were expecting an ""action RPG"" as while it certainly does have some of those characteristics, make no mistake, this is a very difficult game at times.   The combat is definitely souls inspired though it is quite unique in some ways, as there is effectively no base blocking mechanic but rather you basically build up energy to unleash heavier attacks and you can do so via dodging perfectly or many basic hits on an enemy (to put it simply). At first as a souls enjoyer I struggled to understand what they were expecting and the combat initially felt clumsy and not at all tight.   But once you lock in and start learning how to perfectly dodge, there is nothing more satisfying than pulling off multiple perfect dodges back to back, with a very satisfying audio and visual effect to indicate you did pull off a perfect dodge. But it took me hours of dying to the first 'boss' (Wandering Wight) to finally realise the combat is fast, punishing but immensely satisfying and I think that is being overlooked with all the drama surrounding the game.   That being said, I would have loved a ranged option to deal with the very annoying archers that appear regularly and for a monkey man, he seems to have a distinct lack of climbing ability which seems a bit odd  On that note, we all probably know the premise of the story and it is presented beautifully, if slightly confusing if you are unfamiliar with the source material. The Chinese mythological setting of the game is not something I have played in often if at all, so it makes for an interesting and original setting for me and the fact it is absolutely beautiful and atmospheric is just icing on the cake here. They have created some full AAA quality cutscenes to move along telling the story and they feel not unlike the grand cutscenes in God of War in scope and quality, they really have done a great job here in my opinion.   The world is absolutely beautiful with a very distinct Unreal 5 look to it, though it is very linear with some limited exploration to be had but you will often find an invisible wall stopping you from venturing off the trail and they maybe could have been a bit more creative with how they keep you in the limits of the map without just straight up invisible walls but for me this is just a minor complaint.   Sound is great and of course the graphics are stunning, though of course with the caveat that this is an Unreal 5 game and it uses all the latest visual fluff, so don't think you're going to max this out on your GTX 1050 and have good time. But it scales well and if you follow guides like the Hardware Unboxed optimisation guide you should be able to get it running well on very modest hardware.   In summary I think this is one game that surprisingly lived up to the hype, while it isn't perfect I think overall these guys have done an amazing job for their first big release and it could very well end up being one of the top games of this year.   I think a big thing to understand as a potential buyer going into this game, is that it is VERY difficult at times and this I am sure is going to catch a lot of people out as an unpleasant surprise.",1029,0.923444092273712158,76561198203292090,102.6,1090

2024-09-13 17:11,74.0,推荐,"[h1] Blooming proudly in the barren desert of AAA titles [/h1]   [h2] 8.5/10 [/h2]  [h3] Opening [/h3]  For a long time, whenever talking about China's game industry, it seems that countless players have sighed and lamented. Though its market value is tremendous and cannot be underestimated, the entire industry is almost supported by online and mobile games, and there are few achievements in AAA single-player games. In this context, August 20, 2024, would definitely be an unforgettable day for Chinese gamers. The future of Chinese single-player games, Black Myth: Wukong, has officially been released. On its first day, it has already reached a stunning 2.2 million players, and as of today, its total sales have reached 18 million copies, not only did it set a new first-week sales record among its genre, but also became the single-player game with the highest peak player count on steam. As the Chinese saying goes, 'A big tree attracts the wind'. While Black Myth: Wukong has won a large number of fans, it has also faced widespread questions and criticism. Can the quality of this game live up to such outstanding sales and an incredible number of players?  [h3] Strength [/h3]  Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a work whose merits outweigh its flaws. Though its strengths and weaknesses are clear, we cannot dismiss it completely because of this. Games featuring traditional Chinese landscapes, realistic cultural scenes such as Buddha statues and temples, and Chinese Taoist Mythology are rare nowadays. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, this game showcases a level of visual refinement and scene interactivity that is beyond the reach of most previous AAA titles, the realistic and delicate scene interaction brings players an immersive gaming experience, and the stunning art is enough to allow players to indulge in this gorgeous world where every screenshot feels like wallpaper. Huge game worlds, rich game content, and a wide variety of enemies are ahead for players to explore, the game and combat in each chapter are unique and thrilling, the amazing music adds an immersive atmosphere to it, too. The movie-quality cutscenes are of extremely high standards in terms of camera movement and performance effects. The ending animations of each chapter, which are in different styles, are well-made and profound in connotation.   Though the plot narrative technique is rather obscure and difficult to grasp, the in-game journal fully supplements the worldview, characters, and background in the form of fables or stories. Reading thoroughly will allow you to unravel the plot's complex themes. Countless talents and a wide range of spells for players to freely choose from, thus evolving into numerous genres of gameplay. The game's transformation mechanism is a major feature, combined with the character's flexible body movements and gorgeous battle performance effects, Black Myth: Wukong remains consistently entertaining and engaging in each battle. The final boss and the final hidden boss battles have put a lot of effort into the design of the mechanism, the battle scene, and the artistic conception conveyed. The upgradable that can freely reset and no death penalty have all greatly optimized the player's gaming experience, most players will not find the game overly difficult to complete.  [h3] Weakness [/h3]  Whether in good or bad ways, this game draws heavily on the design of many souls-like games. Even though the plot of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely profound, the overly fragmented storytelling hinders player comprehension. The plot based on the conclusion of the Journey to the West, is very familiar to Chinese players, however, the lack of clear cause-and-effect explanations will likely confuse many others. The journal also contains a vast amount of text, not all players may have the patience to finish it, let alone delve into the original Journey to the West. While the Chinese voice acting is excellent, the English voice acting feels a little lackluster, and misplaced and missing subtitles also show that Black Myth: Wukong still needs to improve in terms of localization. The developer may aim to encourage players to get rid of guides and explore on their own, but in a vast world with interconnected routes, extremely low scene recognition, and high similarity, without route guides and in-game maps, it is very easy to lose your sense of direction when actually playing. The frequent appearance of invisible walls since the third chapter makes it even more difficult for players to judge the true boundaries of the map. Player would find it hard to experience the complete game content without a guide.   The numerous skills and transformations vary significantly in strength, the character's fragile ability to withstand attacks also makes the game have relatively high requirements on the player's reaction ability and operational tolerance. The optimization of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely poor, with problems such as long loading time, frame drops, and crashes often occurring. In terms of the lighting transition between light and dark scenes, and the lighting effects in dark scenes, Black Myth: Wukong also performs extremely poorly. The design of the large bosses in the game, such as Captain wise-voice and The duskveil is problematic, the battle experience is frustrating. The design of the probability of dropping some collectibles is even worse, and compared to the earliest gameplay trailer, the officially released version has cut too much content. Even in the existing chapters, many story elements feel abrupt and lack depth, leaving too many gaps. Although the fifth and sixth chapters are also quite good, they are inferior to the previous chapters, and signs of development rush are extremely obvious.   [h3] Conclusion [/h3]  In a market lacking AAA titles, Game Science has made unremitting efforts and delivered Black Myth: Wukong in 4 years, which is no small feat. Whether through its unique, realistic, and excellent art, or its satisfying and exhilarating comfort, it will definitely make you indulge in it. If you take the time and savor it quietly, you will definitely be shocked and leave endless aftertaste. It should be noted that no matter how good a game is, it will eventually have its audience, and this is especially true for Black Myth: Wukong as an action role-playing game. As the saying goes, 'seeing is believing.' if you can accept the shortcomings mentioned above, you still need to experience it for yourself to understand its mystery.   In the end, Black Myth: Wukong still benefits the vast majority of players on three major levels: in terms of game aesthetics, its success stands in stark contrast to the dismal ending of Concord, which implements political correctness and diversified aesthetics, and will inevitably sound the alarm for the art design of future games; in terms of the game engine, Black Myth: Wukong further demonstrates the massive potential of the Unreal 5 engine, more developers will likely turn to it for game development, which will surely bring games with more stunning visual effects and improved optimization in the future; in the Chinese game industry, the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong has overturned the previous monopoly of online games and mobile games in the market. The potential of single-player games will inevitably drive more Chinese developers to invest in it. Even if you discover that this game isn't to your liking, its popularity will surely bear fruit in the future and will be beneficial to the entire gaming industry.

Feels more like a Chinese version of God of War (because of the mythology) mixed with DMC, with all the skills and stuff. Yeah, this game’s got that PlayStation vibe. After waiting 4 years for this, I gotta say, I’m not disappointed. But, the optimization could’ve been better, especially with the cinematic graphics setting. Other than that, it’s solid—I didn’t get any stutters or crashes, and the game runs super smooth on very high settings.",247,0.836770296096801758,76561199054313806,74.1,497

At first, the game may seem superficial and rather ordinary with the usual boring gameplay, but it is not! Starting from the 2nd chapter, it reveals all its strengths, it is interesting to explore, there are many secrets, the combat system develops into a simply crazy mixture of everything you can imagine and a simply colossal assortment of various bosses, only Elden Ring can compete with it! 81 ratings from journalists, because they did not really play, the maximum they were able to get to the 2nd chapter and draw conclusions) I think that the game deserves more, and such a huge, large-scale game was made by the developers in just 4 years, it really deserves respect!

Growing up I found comfort in the unforgiving challenge and beauty of soulslike games, and now, in what may be my final months, this game has given me a chance to reconnect with that comfort one last time.  The developers have created a visually stunning and mechanically precise action RPG that offers both the challenge and the sense of achievement that we crave. The intricate combat, alongside the visually striking environments, makes every moment memorable.

If you like boss fights, this is the game for you, with there being like 90+ for you to conquer. Some more challenging than others, but all are unique and memorable for you to tackle again on your next playthrough in NG+. Everything in this game works well together; the spirts, spells, vessels…all of them made for some really cool variety in gameplay. The ability to change your build on the fly is a huge plus and I loved the chapter-to-chapter format of the story. Animated cutscene story tales were an awesome touch to bring each chapter to a close. Most of all, I loved finding all the hidden areas and questlines along the way, figuring out secret items and bosses that you might not run into without exploring. All of the achievements were fun to go after, collecting all items and defeating every enemy to complete your journal is an awesome feeling to accomplish. This game deserves all the positive feedback it’s receiving and I hope to see DLC/a sequel in the future!

2024-08-23 21:32,37.2,推荐,"[h1]Not My Game of The Year[/h1]  Black Myth: Wukong was a game I’d been eagerly waiting for since it was first revealed in 2020. Like many others, I was skeptical about whether the developers could deliver on such an ambitious project. I don’t think the Steam reviews and player counts accurately reflect the reality. The overwhelmingly positive reviews and high player counts are largely driven by nationalistic support from China, where the game is celebrated as a major achievement. While my review is positive because I do believe the game is good, I also think it is kind of overrated. As always, I aim to provide honest opinions and a truthful assessment of my experience. I am writing this review after actually completing this game, unlike every review with 2 hours and claiming it GOTY.  [b]Graphics and Optimization[/b]  The game’s graphics are outstanding. The visual fidelity, from the breathtaking environments to the intricate character designs, is top-notch. The animations, visual effects, and render distance are all impressive, adding to the game’s overall looks. The sound effects are equally well done, though the soundtrack leaves much to be desired. While the game runs smoothly for the most part, Chapter 3, particularly the snowy maps, does suffer from performance issues. Despite this, the overall optimization is solid, and the game manages to maintain its high graphical standards without too many hiccups.  [b]Bosses and Combat[/b]  The bosses in Black Myth: Wukong are a real feat to play against. When it was revealed that the game had 81 bosses, I was sure that at least half of them would be replicated, similar to what we saw in Elden Ring. But it's shocking and great to say that more than 90% of the bosses in the game are unique, each one fun to play and mostly well-designed. However, most of the bosses are surprisingly easy. Speaking of difficulty, I’ve seen some people argue that Wukong isn’t a Soulslike, but I would definitely consider it one. It has everything a Souls game offers, except for the corpse-run mechanic. It has some similarities to God of War and Bayonetta, but I believe it’s much closer to Soulsborne titles than that.  [b]Game Feel and Combat Mechanics[/b]  The game feels and combat is initially great and fun to play. The fluidity of movement and the responsiveness of controls are great. However, as I played through the game, I found that it became too repetitive for me, even with the large variety of bosses and enemy types. Once you discover which combos and moves work best, there’s little need to change them. The same goes for the Spirit mechanics. The game provides you with a ton of spirits, but once you find a good one and upgrade it, there’s really no need to use others, just like how most people only played with the Mimic Tear in Elden Ring. The spells, while fun to use, also feel limited in variety. Only having four spells for a 40-hour game made the experience feel stale over time. Additionally, the spells cost mana, which restricts their usage, especially during boss fights. Since the most fun aspect of Wukong is using these spells, this limitation is quite a shame. The big skill trees in the game primarily change your passive stats and your heavy attack, which you use rarely. This adds to the repetitiveness of the combat since the skill trees don’t significantly alter how you engage in battles, making the combat feel even more repetitive as you progress.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313750794  [b]Story and Characters[/b]  When it comes to the story, Black Myth: Wukong seemingly tells the story of Journey to the West. I have no prior knowledge of this story or the movie, so I didn’t get much out of it. The mute protagonist doesn’t help either. The game seems to expect players to be familiar with the original story, which made it hard for me to connect with the narrative.  [b]Level and Map Design[/b]  The level and map design is by far the worst part of Black Myth: Wukong and the major thing that severely impacted my experience, reducing the enjoyment I got from the game by miles. In Chapter 1, the level design is very linear—you kill a few enemies, 30 seconds later comes an amazing boss fight, you kill another bunch, and a minute later, another spectacular boss fight. This pattern repeats until the end of the chapter. At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this; it felt odd and almost made the game seem like a boss rush experience. But since I was enjoying the heck out of the bosses, I loved this design choice, and fighting new bosses every 10 minutes was such a joy. This continued the same way until I reached the Tiger Vanguard boss fight, which is the peak of Black Myth Wukong in terms of game design tempo. The boss was one of the best in the game. At that point, I was sure I was playing the Game of the Year 2024 and possibly one of the best action games I've ever played.  Unfortunately, that's when the game began going downhill. By Chapter 3, the game started to feel very repetitive, with the same combat mechanics being reused over and over. In Chapters 2 and 3, you start playing in huge, open world-ish maps. Now, is that a bad thing? Elden Ring did the same, right? No, because Wukong's maps are filled with limiting invisible walls everywhere. There are hundreds of the same enemies throughout the map, and you often go in a direction unsure if it's worth your time. You never know if you’ll find a new boss, an invisible wall, a little XP, or just nothing at all. I found myself sprinting around the huge maps only to find nothing most of the time, as there was no indicator if the journey was worth it. What adds to the frustration is that the game doesn’t guide you to your main objective, or even clearly define what it is. So, if you’re bored of aimlessly wandering around, you can't simply rush to the main quest. This lack of direction makes the game feel even more disjointed and tiresome. The issue peaks in Chapter 6, where the game becomes a frustrating slog. There’s never an indoor-level design to alleviate this, except for one extremely linear and frustrating dungeon. The lack of a map or compass is a particularly bad decision, especially since even FromSoftware addressed this with Elden Ring. The graphical quality of the maps is insane, but they look extremely bland and uninspiring compared to the art design of Elden Ring. This detracts from the game’s atmosphere and overall enjoyment.  [b]Music and Soundtrack[/b]  The music and soundtrack are also quite poor, which significantly affects the atmosphere of the world. The only song I liked was the one sung by the headless dude; nothing else stood out. No Soulsborne or Soulslike game has ever come close to the level of Dark Souls 3's soundtrack, and Wukong doesn’t change that.  [b]Bugs and Glitches[/b]  Many bosses and enemies have a tendency to freeze during fights, some even becoming invincible. These bugs made me replay the same enemies several times.  [b]Conclusion[/b]  In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is a good game, even though it’s far from meeting all of my expectations. Despite its shortcomings, it is a very solid entry from Game Science. I will be highly looking forward to their next game as much as I did for Black Myth: Wukong, hoping they will improve upon these shortcomings and deliver an even more polished experience. I don’t have a definitive Game of the Year candidate for this year, but I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong isn't it. For me, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown stands out as a better title.

2024-09-02 01:14,17.2,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong has truly set a new standard for action/RPG games,  the game is a stunning world that brilliantly blends mythological elements of the Monkey King,  (a trickster god) <- Journey to the West novel.  Graphics: The visuals are incredibly striking, from landscapes, world & character design, fluid animations, and lush environments all is crafted with care and detail.  It's a treat for the eyes.  Game-play and Mechanics: Movement and combat is very fluid and has a sharp feel of control,  a well set balance between challenge and victory aka the reward.  With the combination of spells , magic and another thing that i just cannot mention here cause of spoilers (not even a hint - sorry).   Game-play is fantastic, encounters are fresh and exciting ,  i just love the huge amount of Bosses in this game, and many are hidden , some have quests u can do with a variety of rewards such as upgrade material or a extra Vendor.  Story and Characters: The narrative draws from the classic Chinese epic ""Journey to the West,"" , by showcasing elements of Chinese mythology and folklore, the game not only entertains but also educates about a rich cultural heritage.  What stood out for me was that the story is driven by conflicts that involve not only physical battles but also moral and philosophical dilemmas.  Again a lot of attention to detail.  Conclusion: Black Myth: Wukong is a awesome game. I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for future updates (DLC?), as this game has set the bar higher for others in the genre.",35,0.764632701873779297,76561198077658932,114.8,71

It’s so clear that there was a ton of love poured into this game, so many little nods and extra effort put into even the little things that you cant help but be charmed by it all.  It’s very polished, only occurred a couple minor bugs throughout my playthroughs, and once you figure out how the game works and the map progression plays out, it’s very rewarding and plays through smoothly. I will say though, the idea of stances is fun - but I never found much of a reason to swap from the default smash stance and just crank out the big damage.  I don’t really have too many complaints besides the combat being a little spammy, but that kind of works because it lets you focus instead on learning to react to the bosses, rather than managing a ton of complex mechanics on your end.  I 100% the game because I enjoyed the game so much. (Also bought the 8bitdo black myth: wukong edition controller, it's my new go to now.)

Surprisingly lots of hidden secrets and side quests, best part is you can backtrack and do all the side quest even after completing the chapter.  9/10 would be nice if we have more exploration instead of linear progression path but this is just personal preferences. Also Chapter 4 is peak.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update after 100hours of playtime: I've completed pretty much everything the game can offer, except maxing out all Spirits and Equipments (you need about NG+5 to get enough Knot of Voidness for all Spirits upgrade). I like how the game gives you a secret stance but require a lot of work for it, too bad it can't last long (That's what she said).  You definitely don't need to do new playthrough but highly recommend trying out NG+1 as you get some new stuff to play with. The scaling for NG+3 onwards is a bit 'unbalanced' as you pretty much hit the cap of scaling of your damage/defence but enemies/bosses just scale harder than you, which can makes it a bit unfun.  Still a great game, prob GOTY 2024 for me.",75,0.741326510906219482,76561198211221445,100.1,591
2024-08-21 20:53,19.9,推荐,"9/10 for this game, Game of the year  Epic level game, a rare Eastern legendary story. The entire game is exquisitely crafted, with excellent performance effects and top-notch music and sound effects. This game is a milestone. Of course, for friends from non-Asian cultural circles who want to understand the story of this game, they must be familiar with relevant literary works (Journey to the West). The localization of this game is also a challenge. As Chinese people, we are easy in understanding the dialogue and lines in the game, because the story of Journey to the West is well known to women and children, but for English players, some lines with a large number of religious, mythological and ancient Chinese (classical Chinese) elements will bring no small understanding challenges.  史诗级游戏，一个罕见的东方传奇故事。整个游戏制作精良，具有出色的表演效果和一流的音乐和音效。这款游戏是一个里程碑。当然，对于非亚洲文化圈的朋友来说，想要了解这款游戏的故事，必须熟悉相关的文学作品（《西游记》）。这个游戏的翻译也是一个挑战。作为中国人，我们不难理解游戏中的对话和台词，因为《西游记》的故事对妇女和儿童来说是众所周知的，但对于英语玩家来说，一些带有大量宗教、神话和中国古代（文言文）元素的台词将带来不小的理解挑战。  Let's talk about some flaws in the current game: 1) There is no scene map, and for players who are not accustomed to exploring and wandering maps, finding their way may pose some challenges. 2) The game does not have difficulty adjustment options, and some bosses are very challenging. 3) The skills of the BOSS unit are not clearly indicated, making evasion difficult. 4) There is no way to pause during cutscenes, or it is difficult for non Chinese users to read lines (subtitles are too small), and there is no way to view ""historical dialogue records"".  让我们来谈谈当前游戏中的一些缺陷： 1） 没有场景地图，对于不习惯探索和漫游地图的玩家来说，找到自己的路可能会带来一些挑战。 2） 游戏没有难度调整选项，有些BOSS非常具有挑战性。 3） BOSS的技能没有明确指出，这使得闪避变得困难。 4） 过场动画中没有停顿的方法，或者非中文用户很难阅读台词（字幕太小），也无法查看“历史对话记录”。",95,0.790655076503753662,76561198018353530,55.7,0

2025-03-03 03:45,208.3,推荐,"As someone who didn't even know the game was coming out and was in the making for years, this was a pleasant surprised.  I am Chinese so all of the story is very familiar, however, even if you didn't have a childhood of Wukong stories, lots of Animes and media today includes parts of the mythology, like Goku from dragon ball, abilities from Naruto and so on.  The story on its own is incredibly interesting, the game tells the narrative in a unique way through out the game and especially the special animations at the end of each chapter. So if you are a story / campaign type player, you are definitely not left out. Also, if you happen to be familiar with the actual story itself, you will understand lots of the characters and references quickly as you play.  On the gameplay side of things, it plays like a souls game, but with extra steps. Invincibility frames on the dodge, bosses having patterns to recognise and defend against, stamina on attacks and movement, bonfire type check points and healing potions. What differs is the in depth combat mechanics like ""see through"" or ""rock solid"" which are basically parries, along side with other spells to change the style of play. All of the options give each player the ability to form their own build and gameplan depending on what they like.  Graphics in this game is just fantastic, I have never seen anything like it. From the environment, to entities, to the exceptionally well made cut scenes, everything just looks perfect. Personally, I haven't had a single case of performance issues, but you can't just take it from me alone, all of my friends who play the game also do not recall having any problems with performance.  Lastly, I just want to talk about content. There are several chapters in the game, each with different lengths. The base game without any side quests seems like any other story game, not too long, not short. However, as you play, you start to see the enormous amount of endless secrets hidden within each chapter, some you find simply with luck. Each chapters secret content can give you a leg up on the final boss of the chapter. Chapter 1 simply gives you a separate boss arena and an additional boss, however compared to chapter 4, where you can stumble upon a whole another chapter within that chapter. All of these side quests leads up to more secret content in the final chapter, which ultimately will allow you to achieve the secret ending.  Great game.",25,0.722215950489044189,76561199364067815,208.3,32

2024-08-21 01:28,4.1,推荐,"[h1]Preface[/h1] Ever experience one of those moments in life when you're thankful to have lived long enough to witness an event? Honestly, I am blown away by the quality of Black Myth Wukong, and after completing chapter 1 in full, I can wholeheartedly say it is one of the most polished games in recent years to carry on the torch toward another golden age of gaming; an era in which we can say NO to delusional propaganda led by the woke crowd and truly immerse ourselves in masterful storytelling and peak gameplay.  [h1]Positives[/h1] [b]Enriched Storytelling[/b] A unique take on an existing mythological tale. Great storytelling in post-2020 media is a rare breed and Black Myth Wukong brings back a practice that many have forgotten in the past decade: the ancient art of ""show, don't tell."" As a result, a player with more than half a brain cell becomes intrigued, piqued with curiosity as to where the journey will take us next. That very simple step that produces the foundation of a great game, in and of itself, is something many fail to do in this generation. Hence, a praiseworthy achievement.  [b]A Realm To Visit More Than Once[/b] From the first cutscene to being dropped into the world as an unknown adventure taking on the mantle of the hero Wukong, the environment takes your breath away. There is an ever-so-subtle ambience that is neither noisy nor silent, overwhelming nor underwhelming... neither raging nor soothing to the senses. It is the perfect balance of making you feel like you want to stay there forever yet progress to see what comes next. The mob enemies you come across are not as threatening as you may think, but provide a challenge once you approach. Bosses have a variety of moves and behaviors that allows you to enjoy the interaction throughout the grueling battles, and they're not mindbogglingly difficult enough to make you throw your controller out the window. The level of detail and quality placed into each animation of both the character and enemies, down to the simple action of opening a chest to find new gear/items shows the amount of love and passion that went into this project.  [b]Depth & Progression[/b] As with storytelling, the character progression in the game is less so about ""wanting to become stronger"", but rather a sense of wanting to see what comes next in your journey. The other myriad of games I've played over the past few years have molded me into an elitist player, one who always min/maxes when he can to reach the endgame as quickly as possible before anyone else to play god. Every now and then, however, I come across a game that I go into with a different mindset; a mindset that allows me to slow down, take a breath, and enjoy the journey rather than seek the end result in a heartbeat. Two heartbeats rather than one: the difference is astounding when it comes to the human mind.  [b]Absence of Woke Propaganda & Nonsense[/b] Whenever I browse the internet in any form, I grieve at the thought of how the woke propaganda is contaminating our minds day by day, trying to brainwash the normal human mentality with ideas of delusion to make the abnormal a norm by forcefeeding outrageous ideas down our throats. Black Myth Wukong, in all of its so-called ""controversies"", takes a step closer to our roots. Not toxic masculinity. Not sexism. Not lack of diversity. Just a pure journey that rids our bodies and minds of any sense of superiority, inferiority, representation, diversity, abnormalities, delusion, or any of that other nonsense. This is a game, in all of its glory, that takes us back to the roots of a character that embarks on a journey. That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less. And I'm all for more of it in the years/decades to come.  [h1]Negatives[/h1] [b]Invisible Wall Implementation[/b] So... this one's a bit of a divisive issue. Most open world games implement an invisible wall feature to block off players from areas that are ""in the world"" but inaccessible in-game, primarily to help with immersion. Black Myth Wukong does this flawlessly to make it so the world is there in its entirety with no questionable areas whatsoever, enough so that it's impossible to tell which parts of the world are accessible and which are not. This is one of those rare situations wherein if the player would really benefit from a map that at least displays the general area. But add to the fact that there is no map to refer to, it can get annoying when exploring for chests and/or spirits.  The reason this might be an arguable pro/con is that most game companies have been getting flack during the past few years for spoonfeeding players to go here and there with an overly complicated and detailed map/UI (I'm looking at you Ubisoft). Games like Elden Ring had a natural flow to exploration with the use of a map so players can just have a general idea of where they are. Black Myth Wukong took exploration to even higher levels of letting the player have the freedom to do what he wants, yet some may argue that in this case the use of clear invisible walls might have helped (ironically).  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] [b]Final Verdict: A+[/b] Nowadays, a game doesn't have to be perfect or even called ""superb"" to be worthy of praise. So many games drop the ball fast and hard, trying to stick political agenda into video games or going for greedy live-service routes that don't last more than a few months. Gamers may need to touch grass sometimes, but we're not always stupid or braindead either. Above all, we're a customer base looking to buy a product that provides enjoyment.  The return of the singleplayer game with a strong foundation of lore and gameplay is what I believe put the gaming industry on the map in the first place. And now that the industry has tried its hand in so many possible paths to try to find the ""perfect route"" to a stable era of gaming, titles like Elden Ring, Nioh, Ghost of Tsushima, and now Black Myth Wukong have proven time and time again that the single player action-RPG has once again laid a solid foundation to the path that truly satisfies the core audience.",28,0.711766242980957031,76561198846982278,143.6,617

It's a fun game to play, not as hard and challenging as Souls games except for some minibosses(After getting stronger you can come back and defeat them. I might have struggled because I was a bit stubborn but some of them really felt unfair.). The action is pretty good but both combos and spells lack variety. There are different stances but they only change your heavy attack, so you end up using the same light attack combo throughout the entire game. Some upgrades allow you to modify your light attacks but it's still not enough.  Enemies between bosses feel too random and sometimes meaningless. Chapters 5 and 6 seem rushed for the deadline. I like the art style and the graphics are way too good. However, the worst thing about this game is the INVISIBLE WALLS.. there are too many of them and you can't go where you should actually be able to. There might be a better solution for this but it seems the game might have been rushed.

Every fight feels meaningful, requiring patience and strategy, and the boss battles are on another level. I loved how the game balances moments of high-stakes combat with quieter, reflective exploration it gives you time to soak in the incredible atmosphere.  But what truly blew me away was the story.

2024-09-05 01:12,79.3,推荐,"The TLDR version is, yes this is a GOOD game, but definitely not as great as everyone is making it out to be. Looks amazing, it's well optimised (compared to most crap on the market these days), and combat is mostly fun, but that's about where it stops for me. In summary, if you are simply looking for a fast paced martial arts/ ""Samurai"" style game and don't really care about it being new or hyped, I would recommend Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice over this any day.  Here is why (the long version)... As a From Software fanboy and a souls-like veteran, I was excited to see something new and fresh to the genre, and something that may have been able to compete with the aforementioned Sekiro. Black Myth: Wukong starts off strong, but you quickly start to learn all the nuances about the game that make it down right frustrating and, for lack of a better word, crap... here is the list.  - Invisible walls that stop you from exploring areas that look reachable. It gets old really fast.  - There may be a cultural barrier, but the story is simply confusing, disjointed, and doesn't really make sense. It is filled with so much random crap that I stopped caring and started skipping most of the cut-scenes. Not to mention some of the really annoying side characters. I got the main premise of it, but man it was a slog to get through.  - The combat is fast and entertaining, but I would not call it 'crisp' or skill-based. Without writing a 20 page essay on why, just know that you will get 'ripped off' MANY times with missed button presses, interrupted moves, bulls#&t enemy move sets, unavoidable AOE, and just flat out 'cheating' by the bosses. I felt like the combat was too luck-based to be called 'well designed'.  - There are too many 'bosses'. It also gets old real fast. Not to mention, towards mid-game, they just stop dying/ being defeated. They will often flee or just start some random dialog with you before leaving. The satisfaction of ass-kicking gets taken away from you.  - Traversal is tedious and sometimes gets you killed. There is a type of auto-mantle feature that sometimes forces you to jump down ledges you didn't want to. Some of the spawn points are really far from the arena where you died and running there is really annoying.  (Gear Progression in summary: There is a lot of stuff to acquire in this game, but a lot of it feels really pointless.)  - Gear progression is flat-out enraging! For example, there is one armour set that you unlock for crafting quite early, but you don't find all of the materials until much later in the story progression. If you are a completionist like me, it took roughly 20 hours or more to finally craft it! Yes, I could have skipped a bunch of stuff and got the materials, but that many hours is just ridiculous! I kept thinking to myself, ""Oh yeah, it can't be far off now."" This also carries over to upgrading. Another slogfest to get high-end materials.  - Gear progression cont... When you finally do get a piece of gear that you think is going to be amazing, it usually comes with a negative effect or such a small benefit that just makes it not worth it equipping. The game forces you into certain gear for the set bonuses and towards the late-game you just end up using whatever is best. In the late-game, you get a bunch of different gear that gets thrown at you and makes you wonder why you spent your hard earned money/ materials on the other crap. Yes you can make 'random builds' but they are very limited if you actually want to be 'powerful'.  - The skill progression is quite good, but also has some pointless aspects to it. You have 3 different stances for combat, but the gear is usually focused around one of them, making it utterly pointless to switch between them. Again, focusing you into whichever is best for the time. Same goes for your sub-items as well, usually focusing on one particular skill or spell that makes the others pointless. The fact that re-specing is free and easy is a really good part of this game, but honestly I just ran the whole game with one stance at a time. It feels like the game wants you to experiment with different builds and skills, but it is just not worth it.  To finalise: I really struggled to recommend this game, but I have a personal rule that if I have a decent amount of hours or have completed it, it must have been worth it. If you are expecting 'crisp' skill-based combat, like some other games in similar genres, I would not recommend this. You will end up breaking something. It is a really good game from a developer's first 'big title', but they missed the mark on so many things that it just made it frustrating to play for me. It's almost like they 'tried to hard' and added a lot of unnecessary crap, which just ends up conflicting with enjoying the game. Anyway, sorry to ramble, but I felt it needed to be said.

2024-08-23 06:59,28.7,推荐,"After 20 something hours in the game I think I finally have a better grasp on what the games about now. If you want the TLDR of it then I'd say the game is worth picking up, whilst the game certainly has its quirks, it also has really solid gameplay, amazing graphics and a surprisingly compelling story-line for those willing to look deeper into the game. I'd say those reasons make the game worth trying if nothing else.  For those interested in hearing me ramble for a bit, I'd say that this game really wasn't anything that I expected it to be, someone likened it to Chinese God of War, and I’ll admit I can understand why, the levelling system and limited weapons options are very reminiscent of God of War 2018 with attacks and movies being very weighty and full of depth. Personally, I initially thought of game like lies of p with its linear map design and story chapters but the longer I’ve played this the more I’ve realised that Black myth Wukong is a game that subverts expectations.  In the beginning I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of challenge that enemies presented, I thought that the enemies died too quickly and that you had way too much stamina to really strategize with your moves, so combat felt button mashy with no real depth since “ you could easily dodge everything, like,  it wasn’t as if you’d run of stamina anyway” and this made the otherwise cool levelling system useless since I already felt overpowered. Then I encountered wandering wight (the second mini boss) and realised that you needed to have that much stamina otherwise you can’t even participate in the battles much less win.  Then I felt that the game just had too many boss battles, so much so that with how linear the game was it felt like it was a boss rush game with very little to explore or lore to encounter, just boss battle then cutscene a then further boss battles, but this couldn’t be further from the case. While the game has a strong focus on boss battles, it also has many storylines, quests, even hidden lore, cutscenes and entirely new maps to explore for anyone interested in looking. The thing is though, the game is more than happy to have you miss these huge bits of content, the lack of an in-game map and the many invisible walls also make it a little challenging to notice initially but when you do you realise there is a lot more to the game than initially seems with content far more engaging than you’d have thought.  The game subverts these expectations over and over until you start wondering if the flaw you notice in the game is really a flaw or if it's something that's been addressed and you just haven’t gotten far enough or looked deeply enough for it to be resolved. This is the reason that I thought I had to play for a bit before I could comment on it and after so many hours, I think I get finally get it.   I can honestly recommend this as a game worth trying and many only real complaints with it are the often-obnoxious invisible walls and the lack of a player hub of some sort that's unanimously safe. that and the sharpening feature on fsr that makes the images look so much worse. but overall game of the year",45,0.671912312507629395,76561199199001813,206.8,0

Additionally, there are multiple skills available, such as ""Stun Technique,"" ""Invisibility,"" and ""Boss Transformation,"" along with specific weapons designed to counter particularly challenging enemies.  However, a minor drawback is that the game lacks pre-input commands, making the ""Counter"" mechanism dependent on the player's memory of boss attacks, quick judgment, and timing during strikes.

Additionally, by exploring each character’s background story, players can gain a profound understanding of the vast worldview set in ""Black Myth,"" including the greed, anger, love, and the true goodness of every monster, character, and deity.

All the hype, all the praise, all the positive buzz surrounding this game...they're absolutely deserved and this is hands down, one of THE best games of this generation, not just this year. The combat, fluidity of animations, the level and boss design, the intricate level and environmental design, all the different characters and enemies, they're all very unique, varied and superbly crafted. When you take control of the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) you really feel the power behind that staff and every swing you make against your enemies. I won't spoil the details but the gameplay mechanic is very rich and varied and rewarding. There's a whole level up system that can be used to power up your abilities and spells which can be used in subsequent battles. This btw is not necessarily a souls-like game even though some mechanics are present there but the combat style is very fast and responsive. I'm only just scratching the surface of the game and trust me when I say, this is one of the best action RPG games I've ever played in a good while and easily among to very best the game industry has to offer.

Although the movesets are repetitive, the action remains delightful throughout the whole campaign. The multitude of transformations also help to keep the gameplay appealing.  Performance issues are present but don’t ruin the fun. Even when playing on the most recent hardware, occasional stuttering occurs.  Visually, this game is nothing short of stunning. I found myself stopping more than a few times because the world is so beautifully crafted. Characters are engaging, and the story, inspired by Journey to the West, draws you in.  The biggest immersion breaker are the invisible walls scattered throughout the game. What makes it frustrating is the inconsistency: you can’t always predict where they’ll be, so you’re forced to test boundaries constantly.  The voice acting is top-notch. From the sound effects of every weapon clash to the soundtrack, there's nothing to complain about the audio department. It’s so immersive and high quality.  One of the game's standout features is its impressive roster of over 100 bosses. Each one unique and hand crafted. While most bosses are tough but fair, there are around five or six that stand out as especially brutal, echoing the signature of the genre.  One last significant downside of the game is the input buffering. In high-pressure moments when precision matters most, the game can miss your inputs, leading to frustration.  Despite some few issues, Wukong’s beautiful visuals, satisfying combat, and engaging characters make it a game well worth playing. If you're considering buying this game, don’t wait for any sale or discount: this title is worth every cent.

2024-08-22 22:45,30.6,不推荐,"Unlike most people who reviewed this game after 30 minutes and declared it GOTY, i actually played the game. TLDR: Fun at the start, get repetitive really fast and overstays its welcome, with a bunch of glitches and graphical errors.  Graphics and performance: Beautiful, but also really buggy, crashed multiple times, and when moving my character had a constant silhouette of artifacts which were really distracting. At least it had very little frame drops most of the time on a XTX7900 and an AMD 7800X3D.  Gameplay: Basically this is a boss rush game. Nothing more, nothing less. Combat is pretty to look at, basically stays the same for the whole game. Maybe that is why people hype it so much because it is fun at the start but gets boring real quick. Around 95% of the bosses are one shot pushovers which you will have forgotten about 5 minutes after killing them. The other 5% are just frustrating to fight because they were so badly designed especially the later game fights where every boss has at least 2 health bars as well as transition phases that make then immune to you but they will still attack you which go on for far too long. Also mechanics wise they have a lot of very similar moves e.g. basically every later game boss has a move that puts them above your head and makes them shoot a multitude of projectiles at you. Just very repetitive all around. Also game would have really benefited from some sort of map.  Story: Know Journey to the west or don't bother trying to understand who the characters in the game are or what you are doing besides ""get all the monkey king relics"".  EDIT: Forgot to mention the absolutely terrible skill tree.

2024-08-29 18:45,56.0,不推荐,"I guess this is a hot take, so bring on the clown awards, but in my opinion, Black Myth Wukong does not live up to the hype. It's absolutely lacking in so many ways I couldn't believe what I was playing based on the reviews I read and I'm sorry if that steps on the toes of your new favorite game, but it's true. I was in no way compelled to continue playing this after the first session and here's why:  For starters, the game's performance is unstable at best, even on my 3080ti, i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, liquid cooled machine. It constantly and unexpectedly dipped down to laughably low frame rates to the point that I thought the game was being ran by Microsoft Power Point, even with most of the settings on low and medium, RTX off, DLSS set to performance and frames capped at 120. Unacceptable.  Looking past that, the world traversal is some of the most boring gaming I've done in decades. There is nothing to do other than fight a handful of trash mobs, find some meditation spots and then fight bosses. And I mean like every 10ft, there's a new boss. I never even understand why I'm fighting them half the time and they're super forgettable. The title should really be ""Wukong: Boss Rush"" or something more accurate like that. I learn the fights just long enough to beat them and then I never think about them again after they're over.  And the game's scenery is so ridiculously bland that everything looks the same to me. There are no useful land marks and no map/minimap, so you're constantly getting lost and back tracking in circles. On top of that, they do absolutely nothing to make you 'feel' like a monkey God while running around. You have a basic sprint and that's it. No cool flips. No world interaction. No wall runs. No climbing. No swinging. No staff tricks. Not even a double jump... It is painfully boring to run around in this game and OMG the amount of invisible walls and dead ends that should be explorable is infuriating.  The core gameplay loop is: 1. sluggishly traverse through an uninteresting area 2. kill trash mobs until you stumble across a boss 3. spend an hour learning its gimmicky move set 4. finally beat it and repeat, that's it  This game is just way too shallow and bland right now. I got bored in the first sitting and I have no will to even finish it. I will admit though, that the bosses are beautifully crafted and have very imaginative designs that ultimately don't matter because they all seem to have the same basic concept: Rush-down AI, spam attacks, then reset every so often. It felt like I was fighting the same boss reskinned over and over and over, even after 20+ hours of play time. Not to mention that some fights are literally just ripped from other games with almost zero changes, like Ornstein and Smough for example.  Moving on from that, the game's main draw (the combat) is extremely hollow. There is no block system. No backstab system. No stealth system. You literally have a dodge and a stick. The rest comes from a handful of spells, stances and transformations (which are also inconsistent, like, why can't I even JUMP while I'm transformed???) The dodge windows feel awful. Enemies will stun lock you constantly. Tons of CC. Input scanning. Animation locks. Overpowered status effects like poison and fire. Spongy enemies with inflated health pools. Bosses become impervious to your attacks, but they can still hit you. Every cheesy trick in the book to create artificial difficulty and prolonged encounters. It is more frustrating than rewarding and when you finally beat something, you won't feel accomplished, you'll just be happy you got lucky enough to beat the enemy's gimmick one time after hours of failure with nothing to look forward to except doing it all over again in about 10ft.  Wukong, to me, is desperately trying to be a mash-up of Dark Souls and God of War, but it fails on both counts. I think the potential is there, but it still needs a while to cook before it gets to the level that these botted reviews would have you believe it's at. Make the areas/maps more interesting and less linear (a true open world would be even better). Bring these beautiful characters to the forefront and really lean into the story. Make the boss mechanics feel more unique in each fight. Improve the traversal. Optimize the performance. Fix these issues and the game's underlying potential will start to shine through.  It does some things well, like character designs, musical scores, graphics and beautifully cinematic moments, but it falls flat in so many other ways that I genuinely can't recommend this game in its current state. I really wish I hadn't purchased it yet, as it might be worth playing sometime late next year or in 2026. If not, maybe the inevitable Wukong 2 will hit the mark in ways this one couldn't, but as it stands, this ain't it for me. I would refund if I could. ----- Edit: For anyone who might be wondering why my playtime keeps going up after a review like this, it's quite frankly because I paid $60 for the game and I don't want that money to go to waste, so I'm going to finish it.

I’m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression, which is why I do NOT assign a score, I don't believe art can be measured or quantified, I’ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible. [/i]  [b]Overall[/b], I found the game to be quite good. For someone who hasn't read the story of [b]Journey to the West[/b], I really enjoyed how it's presented here, especially the cinematics included in each chapter, I'll just say that if you appreciate animation as a medium of cinematic expression, you’ll likely enjoy them as well. I decided to purchase this game for two simple reasons: [b]Dragon Ball[/b] (inspired by Journey to the West) and [b]Elden Ring[/b]. The first one is my past, and the second is my present, and the surprise was quite pleasant. Although the game was heavily touted as being similar to the souls-like genre, I only noticed two aspects: the save points (similar to bonfires or graces) and the way some NPCs’ stories are told (characters who provide you with bits of information and whom you encounter repeatedly as you progress).  In terms of [b]gameplay[/b], Wukong is more akin to a [b]hack and slash[/b] than a souls-like, you could reference God of War and perhaps Sekiro, I mean its progression system is broad and accesible, it's frenetic, challenging, but above all, fun. What I didn’t like is the lack of a parry mechanic, there’s only one mechanic that rewards you for dodging at the right time. For me, the game’s strong point is the number and [b]variety of bosses[/b] (over 80), there’s only one boss that repeats in design, but not in its move set, which I greatly appreciate.  The world of Black Myth is unique and beautiful, with a different [b]map[/b] for each chapter. The downside is that at times it feels somewhat empty, I think they could have placed more difficult enemies or additional content in certain areas, as sometimes exploration doesn’t feel as rewarding.  The [b]music[/b] library is quite extensive and original, with over 70 tracks, most of which are very good. My personal recommendations are: [b]""Celestial Symphony"", ""Nonsense!"", ""If Good And Evil Gain No Due"", ""Flames Have Paved My Way”, ""Destiny"", ""It Was You"", ""Monkey Mind,"" ""The Greatest Yaoguai"", ""Where Lies The Path Ahead"",[/b] and especially [b][i]""Listen Not"".[/i][/b]  My [b]conclusion[/b], I [b]highly recommend[/b] this game if you're a fan of accessible hack and slash games, good graphics (which, for me, aren’t a major factor), animation, narrative that sometimes leaves out details, oriental ambient music, and above all, Chinese culture. However, [b] I do not recommend the Deluxe Edition[/b],the content is entirely in-game (like the music), and the items (weapons and armor) become completely obsolete after the first chapter.

[h1]Premise: [/h1]  The game reminds me a lot of Sekiro, the environments, the absence of a traditional stats leveling system, and the way you increase your core attributes, mana, and health. It also brings to mind Nioh 2, with the ability to equip spirits and its fast-paced gameplay that blends combos and stances seamlessly.  The storyline is captivating, brought to life with cartoonish cutscenes brimming with personality. It’s based on Journey to the West, and the game’s polish is evident throughout. The GUI is beautifully designed, sound effects hit just right, and the soundtrack is solid.  You play as a pre-made character to stay true to the storyline from the ancient Chinese novel. Armor and weapons are obtained through crafting with resources and currency you collect along the way. Flasks can be customized with items that give you temporary advantages, like increased defense or healing over time.  [h1] Mechanics and gameplay: [/h1]  Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t rely on traditional stats like endurance, strength, or agility. It offers a skill-based system. You unlock and enhance skills, switching between stances to explore different playstyles. Respeccing is quick and painless, letting you experiment without needing any annoying items, so you’re always in the action, ready to try something new.  When you die, there’s no soul-dropping. Seriously, who actually enjoys that feature? I’m glad they left it out.  However, the game does have some invisible map walls, and navigation can be a bit confusing at times and to me this is the biggest issue this game has so far.  The game kicks off strong, with great enemy variety, stunning maps, and a slew of unique bosses. The difficulty feels fair, not cheap like in Elden Ring.  You can equip trinkets, but you’ll stick with the same weapon, which you can modify and upgrade. There are no other weapons, but that doesn’t take away from the experience.  [h1]Performance:[/h1]  You’ll need a high-end PC to run this game smoothly, especially if you crank up the settings. It could use some optimization, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Denuvo is causing performance issues.  [h1]Sound and aesthetic: [/h1]  Voice acting is on point, and there are some interesting mechanics like transforming into an insect, bird, or fox, which adds a nice layer of variety.  [h1] Verdict: [/h1]  Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic achievement. It’s got me excited to see what this studio does next. This game deserves its success, and I’m giving it a solid 9 out of 10.",15,0.684786081314086914,76561198003248938,54.3,2601

That is if you're also into action games, while it can be difficult for some but it's definitely worth playing.[/i][/h1]  [i]Not trying to be bias here, but the game's a blessing in a way for most of us, as JTTW fans. To be fair I've not watched the OG 1986 Journey to the West, only 96' TVB version and some other films.. it may not be the greatest adaptation, however I did enjoy the show as a kid. Been waiting for the game since the first trailer around 4 years ago, it did not disappoint.[/i]  Timeline is set after JTTW, basically like a sequel, the story seemed to be very well-thought-out. A masterpiece, I'd say. The lore and backstory may be confusing for players who aren't familiar with JTTW though, some are explained in the ""Journal"", they're long but pretty interesting read. It's not perfect still, due to some flaws such as some minor lighting bugs, camera angles on certain fights and invisible walls in most areas. Game design is alright, there is no map nor indicator so it may be an issue for anyone with [i]fish[/i] memory and/or just couldn't travel around the place much due to time constraint. The objectives/side quests doesn't show anywhere so players need to observe and listen to what the NPCs' are saying which may indicate something along the story as well. Just don't go diving into the game expecting it to be like some sort of chill RPG, or wise you'd be greatly disappointed. You don't get to beat small baddies much, because you'll run into bosses as you progress the story. Game completion time varies, main story can be completed in less than 50 hours, it would definitely go higher if you'd also do other objectives. Do note that some quests/objectives are highly missable in the run. Game visual looks absolutely stunning, the animations and arts are very impressive too. Soundtracks are great, especially the final boss part. Combat is pretty decent, great variety of abilities to choose from. Often times activating abilities and healing feels like there's a delay to it though, perhaps that's just how it's intended to be in the game. Difficulty-wise it starts off souls-like kinda style, but as the player progress on upgrading better stats after (presumably around Chapter 2-3) it will eventually feel more of a hack n' slash.. I find some of the bosses are tough to beat still. One thing to note is that Chapter 6 feels rather rushed, I got lost long enough trying to figure out where to go and what to do. Nevertheless I've beaten the game (aside from missing a few quests) at 110+- hours with [b]Spell Bind[/b] most of the time, occasionally with a few stat boost from medicine. There's just lots of stuff to do in the game, that said it's quite time consuming for achievement hunters.  Despite some of those mentioned flaws but the game's easily 10/10 for me.

2024-09-02 20:26,106.3,推荐,"I finished the game yesterday, including a good portion of a NG+ playthrough to ""clean"" the remaining achievements, and I have to say that with very few exceptions I've been impressed more and more with it with every passing hour. It's not without its share of flaws (what game is, really?), but as first effort from a newly formed studio this was nothing short of an outstanding achievement.  Solid and mostly satisfying combat, good level design with tons of branching paths and secrets to uncover, staggering amount AND variety of content (with an absurd number of very distinctive boss fights), excellent production value and cinematography across the board, decent level of challenge from some of the toughest bosses (I think goddamn Erlang made me piss way more blood than anything in a FromSoft game so far), etc, etc.  Personally the only glaring issues I can point and the things I'd like to see improved in their future games are:  - they should work on ways to eliminate or mask their ""invisible walls"" more seamlessly. Stumbling on one currently can be fairly jarring, especially because it seems to be an almost unnecessary oversight, given the overall technical prowess of the game.  - the formula would benefit from having more advanced navigation and traversal options unlocked over time (Metroidvania-style). You know... double jumping, a grappling hook, breaking special walls, that sort of stuff.  - While the combat is more good than bad (at least good enough to count as a net positive for the game) I would appreciate if they could make everything a bit tighter: better sense of impact on receiving and landing hits, clearer""tells"" from enemy moves, a bit less ""visual noise"" in the most frantic moments of action.   On a side note, I have no idea why so many reviewers insist on stressing that ""this isn't really a Souls-like"", because I can't think of any other series that it resembles more closely. The way the content is paced, the checkpoint system, the fact that everything except bosses respawns if you die or rest, how healing and consumable work... These are all almost a 1:1 match to most From Software title, and even the camera, lock-on system and combat are way closer to a Sekiro than they are to, say, a God of War or Devil May Cry.  Anyway, to say I was pleased with the time I spent on the game would be an understatement. It's currently an easy candidate for my personal GOTY 2024 with nothing in sight ready to challenge it (but I have yet to play a remaining good half of Shadow of the Elder Tree).   I'll be there for whatever this studio comes up with next. Well, at least in the hope they'll capitalize on what they learned here if they don't decide to swap genre entirely.",28,0.627185702323913574,76561197970550816,108.5,1530

The movement and dodging also feels very poorly implemented. It feels like you have constant input lag. When you land a heavy attack it doesn't feel rewarding because of the randomness (sometimes you get interrupted, sometimes you don't).  The level design is very strange, in a bad way. You get tired of trying to reach places and explore because of the inconsistent and invisible walls.   The bosses doesn't feel significant or interesting since you stumble upon new ones constantly. No build-up or back story to get the excitement up before the next boss.  I'm not even going to get started on ranged enemies.  No FOV adjustment. Extreme over-sharpening of the graphics with no ability to turn it off RUINS the beauty. Camera movement is incorrectly implemented and extremely annoying.

2025-01-18 05:49,38.6,推荐,"As the game which was sort of advertized by media to be ""the first Chinese AAA game"", I would say that Black Myth Wukong certainly lived up to my expectations. With a thrilling world based on mythology with Yaoguais offering all sorts of unique species, it is truly a world to enjoy. However, alongside the praise certainly comes some major criticisms that highly impacted my enjoyment in the long run.  Starting off I naturally want to give some praises where due, which include but are not limited to: + The visual storytelling and cinematics are beyond amazing + Incredibly nice graphics and a beautiful world to explore + A wide variety of bosses offering unique fighting styles and challenges + A dynamic and enjoyable fighting style of the Destined One makes it very engaging and you don't grow tired of it throughout the game.  But here then, are things that for me hold it back from even dreaming of a 10/10 rating. - I'll start off with by far the worst part of the game, and that's how easily missable extra content is. Playing this game without a step by step guide or spoiling for yourself, will guarantee content being locked away. And that's the worst part! Not only is it missable, but the game with actively lock it away for the rest of the playthrough if you make certain progresses. I missed out on an essential storyline of which gives the secret ending of the game, and of which barred me from multiple secret bosses, for, and I kid you not, not finding and talking to a certain NPC, hiding behind a certain pillar, within a certain temple, within a certain temple district, in Chapter 3. And because I failed to notice him even being there, he despawned FOREVER when I progressed to chapter 4, so I couldn't even go back to continue the quest. This one hidden NPC locked me away from half a dozen bosses, and the secret ending. And there are practically no cues for you to expect them to be somewhere, nor what will cause them to disappear. It's utter bs and so if you want to experience everything within one playthrough, you HAVE to follow a guide to make sure you not only do everything but also IN THE RIGHT ORDER, cause the game sure as hell doesn't explain it. - Chapter 4 has a segment of the big area of which many experience major frame drops, this is due to webbing in caves and alike, and as a result I would recommend for anyone entering chapter 4, to go into their settings and to turn ""Hair Quality"" to low so that you won't lose out on performance. My RTX 3080 struggled holding even 60fps otherwise.  - Certain bosses have some really bs attacks or abilities that can get really annoying to deal with. I get it, Wukong is a hard game with hard bosses, and I don't complain about that. I beat every boss the game allowed me to fight. HOWEVER, I don't think it's reasonable difficulty, when say, a certain boss just spawns tornadoes that stunlock you with zero indication and reason, or when you're knocked out of a heavy attack moments before it lands over the weakest of moves, or when the boss enters a sort of animation when transitioning between phases, of which it temporarily leaves itself open EXCEPT YOU CAN'T TO ANY DAMAGE (multiple bosses are guilty of this but none worse than Cloudtreading Deer). There is no worse feeling than thinking the boss is open for a major blow so you unleash a big heavy, or maybe a powerful spell move, like a vessel or alike, just for everything to be nullified cause he's just preparing for what to do next and you can't just hurt him when he's in the middle of buffing to kill you! - Another case-per-case issue, but some of the bosses in this game give fake healthbars, some may not care as much but when I see a healthbar I like to assume that when it's empty, I'm done. Dark Souls 3 is another huge meanie about it but there is some bosses in this where I feel it takes the piss out of me.  Now despite these major annoyances, I do still recommend the game, my playthrough of what I did took a bit under 39 hours but it may vary, especially if you are newer to the genre, of if you're planning on doing more or less extra content than me. Personally this is an 8.5/10 game for me, with the rants above being my main explanations for what caused cuts in my enjoyment, the content locks being by far the biggest factor.",23,0.610842585563659668,76561198420200341,38.6,573

2024-09-27 12:27,88.9,不推荐,"The game has enough recommendations already so I choose to put this review on the not recommended section, click bait aside I do think that the game is over rated.  I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game.  The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map.  I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there arethousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side.  The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.  Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve.  You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers.  Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue.  Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues.  Overall it's a solid first AAA Chinese game but they need to improve their story telling for their next game.",29,0.601339161396026611,76561197973378280,88.9,241
2024-10-19 19:26,58.0,推荐,"I just finished the game and it's a solid 9/10! I had a great experience!  I never thought I would enjoy what seemed to be like a souls-like combatwise, but the game was much more than that. Rather than the sluggish, slow pace of souls-likes, Wukong is fast-paced, dynamic and fun from the go. As you advance, you get more tools in the form of spells, transformations, items, etc. to tackle the hardest of opponents. The gameplay is an immense joy from start to finish.  I had some issues following the story, as I know next to nothing about the legend of Sun Wukong. The game is an imagined sequal to Sun Wukongs legacy, so I would say knowing about it beforehand will elevate the story for you. That being said, the chapter stories are well told and executed and carried some emotional weight as well.   World and feeling is amazing. The game looks beautiful and it ran well on my four year old rig. I had to tune some settings, but the game ran at 80-100+ fps at all times - and looked stunning, even with some settings turned way down. A downside about the game world is first of all a lack of a map - there are so many areas, secret ones included (I managed to finish them all with A LOT of backtracking). The areas have lots of invisible walls and it's not always clear where you are ""allowed"" to go or not. Other games border the play area a lot better and more clearly.   The game (side content included) was just shy of 50 hours, which is absolutely worth the money imo. I've yet to go New Game+, but I know that it has more (new) items, spells, etc. and could be a fun romp.   I highly recommend this game :-)",29,0.600586831569671631,76561197970788678,58.0,0
2025-01-10 08:23,44.7,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong was one of the best games I played last year. Its presentation is incredibly impressive, everything from the combat, story, sound and visuals really stands out.  The gameplay is actually quite different to what is mainly presented online, the game is mainly portrayed as a souls like however other than some similarities in design it’s very much a unique action game with very tight combat, its pacing is more akin to Hack and Slash games such as Devil may cry. You play as Wukong, a very agile and powerful monkey that is on a journey. The story is definitely not an easy one to follow especially if you have no experience with its source material, “A journey to the West” the game is based on the classic novel and has tons of Chinese mythology which was incredibly unique and very different to recent action games the unique enemies, locations and interactions instantly made this game so interesting because it seemed all so different and unusual. The combat is very well made and all of the moment to moments action feels responsive and full of energy. The combat system is reliant on a few core features, the main being the skill tree where you will unlock new attacks, abilities, upgrades and extra bonuses. There is also unique armour and weapons that can craft along the way throughout your journey, the game offers you new armour quite frequently which was really great however it never really gives you the opportunity to mix and match armour since usually the newest thing you got was the strongest. The boss design overall was great, every large scale fight stood out and quite a few of them were very unforgettable. Just when you think you have seen all the game has to offer it suddenly introduces a new boss that's even crazier than the last. The pacing generally was really smooth and I only really got stuck a handful of times on a few bosses. Fortunately some extra xp/level grinding managed to get me through these encounters. The whole game itself is fairly confusing as you play through trying to grasp an idea of what's going on but that was part of the fun as you went from area to area discovering new locations as well as more friends and foes. One thing that I wasn't a huge fan of was the last section of the game, chapter 5. The whole chapter is set in this very large open area unlike any other part of the game, it felt a little rushed and the area felt very empty and lacking any true purpose other than to show off some new abilities. The actual boss fights however were great, but it just lacked in quality compared to the rest of the game. Fortunately you can find some good guides on the internet that will allow you to get through this area quicker.    The visual presentation is crazy, there are so many areas with drastically unique colour palettes and core themes. The characters, bosses, general enemies, armour and weapons all are crafted in extremely high detail. The environment art really stands out here, the lighting is always dramatic and the composition of many of the set pieces and main story sections were awesome to see. The slightly more linear design for the most part of the game really helped the artists design some really great locations, half of the fun was just seeing all of the new stuff as you play. The audio here is also just as great as the rest of the game, the sounds of your weapon clashing with foes sounds awesome and the atmospheric sounds really make the game feel alive as you wandered around in quiet forests and dark caves. The music for the most part takes a back seat in the game however when required the music really picks up with a very strong orchestral soundtrack which really adds to the action and excitement of the gameplay.   The performance is generally very strong, a couple of areas in the middle of the game there seemed to dip in performance a little but nothing that ruined the experience. Hopefully with some more patches/updates as time goes on these issues may become less apparent. The game will definitely require a higher end pc to play as the visual presentation is very graphically demanding. Fortunately the game offers quite a large amount of options to tune the game to your liking. As for bugs and issues I also had no serious problems, I did, however get stuck in a few spots. I don't think I was supposed to be a handful of times in the 5th chapter. Fortunately Wukong has quite a few options to get the player unstuck. Other than that I had no major problems.  In conclusion Black Myth: Wukong is definitely worth your time, it deserves all of the praise it's getting and I really hope that they consider a DLC or some form of a follow up to this game. It's going to be very hard to top what they have created, this game is one of the best things i've played in a while, it was well paced, full of surprises and challenged me just enough without being annoyingly tough.

By the time I reached the middle chapters I found myself wanting to push through just to see how the story unfolds.  The story follows the classic Journey to the West tale, which is interesting, especially for players who are not familiar with Chinese mythology. The scenes between chapters are beautifully animated and make the story feel real. While the game has some elements of soulslike, it has enough of its own to be a good game.  Overall, it's a great debut that shows the growing impact of Chinese developers in the gaming industry.

There are certain areas in the game that really stand out, especially as you get towards the end game. You can see the effort put into the small details that really are meant to bring the word together in a fantastical way.   9/10 Design - The character designs are top notch. They really drive home the lore of the monkey king and utilize everything in their arsenal to bring the story to life. There are moments where it is dark and gritty and there are moments where it is bright and loud. You appreciate all of it  9/10 Story - How can you not enjoy the story of the journey to the west? The developers game science really did a exceptional job with teling the story while also providing engaging and challenging combat. The charatcers in-game all make you feel the story of the world is alive and the best part is the in-game anime/motion scenes that play inbetween chapters to really finalize what you experienced in the play before. They are not cheaply made either. Some of them i wish were full blown series. Fantastic job  8/10 Replayability - The game has an insane amount of hidden content and they offer all of this to you for one single price and no forced DLC purchases. There is alot of hidden bosses to find and little areas to explore. It is not quite open world, but it sure makes you feel that it somewhat is. The level design is top notch and allows for multiple playthroughs to explore every bit of it plus the skill trees and builds you can acquire to alter your playstyle are amazing as well.   9/10 Combat - The combat is incredible, fluid and VERY rewarding. Every hit feels powerful, has good sound to it and offers unique playstyles to keep you engaged.   10/10 Value - Black Myth Wukong offers UNBEATABLE value. The game is a one time purchase with no DLC and offers a massive amount of content to engage with. This is how games shoudl be made and offered with no microtransaction in sight at the time of this review.   Overall I would give this game a solid 9/10 for a score.

2024-11-11 14:51,61.2,不推荐,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.  BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES.  It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?  The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.  With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.  I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen). I'm sure most responses to this review will simply be: ""git gud""",58,0.602937936782836914,76561198096429390,61.2,0

What stood out to me the most were the boss battles. There are so many of them, and each one feels different and challenging in its own way. The variety of enemies is insane too. Just imagine: every creature has its own touching backstory in the game's bestiary!  You can definitely tell the developers were inspired by games like Dark Souls with the intense, thoughtful combat, and God of War for the sheer scale and epic feel of the action. But at the same time, Black Myth: Wukong feels totally fresh and unique because of its Chinese mythology and visual style. That blend of familiar and new kept me hooked the whole way through.   The only thing that felt far from perfect to me was the presence of incredibly large, empty areas in the third part of the game. They invite exploration, but there’s no reward for doing so, which is really disappointing for a detail-oriented player like me.  Last - but not the least - are six cartoons between each part of the game. Wow. They’re stunning - like mini-movies that not only look amazing but add so much to the story. Each one felt like a reward after a tough section, pulling me even deeper into Sun Wukong’s world. By the end, I was completely won over.",2,0.548325955867767334,76561199445320290,52.5,0

2024-10-25 18:23,232.8,推荐,"I am at the end of my 1st playthrough and I would like to recommend this game to anyone. I bought the game due to the hype, which of course was due to the release of the demo back in 2020 when there was a lockdown everywhere. The game looks ""open"" and the fight, the graphics was very very impressive from the demo. The game, was slightly disappointing at first as the game was pretty linear. I mean you can't get lost as the open world is not that open. Since I had spent over 3,300 hrs in Sekiro, I cannot help to find some similarity between the two games in terms of ""openness"". Also, some of the tasks or side quests involved back and forth among places. Without following playthrough videos, I am not sure if I can be where I am now in the game. True, I have made the decision to get 100% in my 1st playthrough so I followed playthrough videos. I was going to moan about it until I arrived at the final chapter. It is hugh and there is no hint whatsoever where and what to do next, especially now I can ""fly""!!! I have to give marks to those videos makers for their time to find things out otherwise I almost certainly will be lost and frustrated. Thinking about it, I suppose that this is their design strategy for ""longivity"", if not for the playthrough videos. Saying that, I have also found out that bosses have different moves in new game plus. And of course, one has to play NG+ because of achievements. Like Sekiro, certain resources are restricted, i.e. they cannot be farmed. Oh, just one important information for all interested new players, the Dev. has nerfed the drop rate of some important resources, not only that, they has added a condition that I personally have not come across in other game, which is that the longer if you stay in a location (due to farming), the drop rate which is already low, will drop even lower. I remembered before the last patch, I got so many precious resources without even trying to farm them. Now, I only got 1 out of 10 runs. Don't get me wrong, you can still farm but you will have to be really really patience. Like any other RPG games, one has to upgrade weapons, armours, items, to get stronger, more powerful. There are quite a few weapons but the Dev. has spent a lot of effort balancing them out. So, you gain some but you will lose some. But this is good, As the players will have to think how to build their Wukong. Oh, yeah, just a warning, you cannot change anything during a combat. Everything has to be set up prior to starting a fight. So, you will have to learn the enemies' moves and ability and then set up your Wukong accordingly. I guess that this is the fun and challenging part (on top of the fight). Similar to Sekiro, in order to play this game effectively and smoothly, you really have to do a lot of tinkering with your graphic settings. DO NOT assume that you have, say, a RTX4090, you can just go into the game at the highest settings and play smoothly. There are a lot of complaints blaming the game by people with RTX 40 series GPU. But using simple logic, I reckon that it is a combination of hardware and software. I have a laptop with RTX 3080 and Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU with 16 Gb RAM. So it is not top notch. But I spent about a couple of days researching and then tinkering, I can play the game smoothly, no problem at 74 FPS at 1K and 65 FPS at 2K (using my brother-in-law's 2K monitor at his home). Sorry, I digressed. Without giving away too much, the combat mechanics of the game can be clunky in certain area but mostly smooth. I guess this may be me not getting used to all the different fighting styles as I am more concentrated on getting all the achievements. So, my advice is to spend a lot of time on each fighting style. By the way, unlike the set up, you can change fighting style on the go. So, if you get experienced in all the different styles, the combat can be pretty impressive. Since I am a diehard fan of Sekiro (maybe Ghost of Tsuhima as well, soon), I cannot help to compare the three in terms of combat and the way players can progress in the game. In Sekiro, one is forced to ""gitgud"" in order to progress (as one has to defeat boss to get past and move on). Tsuhima, the progress of players' ability seems to be easier and more organised. And for Black Myth Wukong, hehe, there is XP farming. I mean I was already level 120 something half way through the game. So, I got through some bosses, not by skills but vitality, i.e. get hurt less. In Sekiro, farming XP only get you skills, not strength nor health so you still have to ""gitgud"". Tsuhima, there is not much farming as most enemies don't respawn after killing them. But upgrading skills can be really powerful, especially the stealth ones. Don't get me wrong. You still have to learn the enemies' moves in Black Myth: Wukong so you can learn the timing when to dodge and when to attack. You can't just go barging in. By the way, stealth is not an option in Black Myth: Wukong. You really have to learn to chain your moves in between dodging and healing in Wukong. Now the story, I thought that this game was loosely based on the infamous ""Journey to the West"" but in fact, it is more based on the book called ""Wukong Zhuan"" (loosely translate to biography of Wukong). Journey to the West was translated to English a few decades ago, but there is no English translation for ""Wukong Zhuan"". I only learnt of this a couple of days ago from a Youtube video posted by a Chinese looking lady from Canada. The video was actually about the explanation of the bad endings of this game. So, if you are interested, you can search for it in Youtube. And yes, in my opinion, according to her explanation and conclusions from ""Wukong Zhuan"", it is pretty ""dark"". I guess that is why the game is called ""Black Myth: Wukong"". Apparently, all the hints are actually in the game, from the conversations, mumblings of various NPC. I didn't take notice of most of it so I didn't know or rather what the story is trying to say. From the game, I only have the impression that Game Science have created a game telling how Wukong can be ""alive"" again. There no strong or obvious hints from objects within the game suggesting what was going on. It was all done by the mumblings and conversations in weird high pitch (which is a turn off for me). So, in my opinion, the story of the game is weak but the game itself is very strong and quite entertaining. I mean I will definitely get into NG+, NG++ and so on.",2,0.5461578369140625,76561197966076282,698.5,214

There are a handful of severe difficulty spikes and areas/bosses that are simply no fun to get through.  The game is often incredible--the cinematic presentation when encountering a new boss or miniboss and simply taking in the stunning vistas keeps you coming back, but the core gameplay is for the most part just adequate. I initially wrote my negative review while struggling through a particularly un-fun section in Chapter 3 (and no, saying that the level is meant to be a vision of hell so it not being fun to play is intentional is asinine).

2024-10-04 09:34,111.7,不推荐,"[h1]Gameplay[/h1] In short, it's a [b]boss rush soulslike game.[/b] The game features 100 bosses, 90 of which are unique with different patterns and designs, and it's awesome. However, as I mentioned, this is primarily a boss rush game. You defeat a boss, fight some regular mobs, and then encounter another boss. Other than that, there are a few NPC questlines, but they're similar to what you'd find in [i]Elden Ring[/i]: you talk to a statue, then talk to the NPC again, and that's it. At least, unlike [i]Elden Ring[/i], some of these quests include cool cutscenes and boss fights, which is a nice touch.  [h1]Open World[/h1] The game is divided into six chapters, and each chapter has its own area. However, except for one, the other five chapters are essentially [b]massive, beautiful corridors.[/b] While this is disappointing, it's not terrible once you get over it.  At least every chapter has its own unique theme—like exploring a lush, green forest in one chapter or venturing into a spider's cave in another.  The only major issue is the [b]secrets.[/b] I’m sorry, but I can’t tell if I’m stupid or if the design is genuinely bad. Locking some of the best boss fights behind secrets is frustrating, and to make it worse, these secrets aren’t even fun to find.  [h1]Story[/h1] So, the main plot revolves around the Heaven Order defeating Wukong and cutting him into six pieces. You play as a common monkey, searching for his relics in each chapter. I haven’t read [i]Journey to the West[/i], and I’m not Chinese, so I can’t say whether they did a good or bad job with the story.  However, one thing I can complain about is that our protagonist [u]doesn’t talk.[/u] It’s stupid. He doesn’t even have facial expressions—it’s like [i]Max Payne 1[/i] where they just slapped a PNG onto the face. I really hope that in a future DLC, they give him a voice or at least some kind of personality.  [h1]Graphics[/h1] The visuals are stunning—beautiful effects, incredible textures, and overall breathtaking design. BUT, [i]unless you play in 4K,[/i] the game looks like a blurry, pixelated, ghosting mess. I don’t care if it’s a great triple-A game; the optimization is terrible. While it’s not as bad as [i]The Last of Us Part 1,[/i] it’s still frustrating.  If you want stable FPS, you [b]MUST[/b] enable frame generation—it’s not an option. Unless you own a very high-end PC, you’re stuck using DLSS or FSR with an average scaling of 50-70%. That’s disgraceful.  Let me clarify: I have a [u]4080 Super and a 7800X3D[/u]—my rig is high-end. So, I’m sorry, but what the hell is going on with gamers? How can they accept such garbage optimization? Yes, this is an [b]AWESOME[/b] game, but if you can’t play it properly, what’s the point?

Roughly 30 minutes in and its the same thing as chapter 1 with the some new scenery.   Combat is mid. Its flashy but uses the same move sets over and over. Skill upgrades are not really cool or fun, and once you master dodge they are useless. Dodge-hit-dodge-hit for about 15-20 minutes so you can run through an area where you  can just hit everything, and fight another boss.   The devs nerf the player and buff the bosses. Its like your hits do nothing at all. You will become more powerful as you level up various skills, but the boss will always be so much more than you will ever be...unless you can dodge, then its just a test of your patience.   I enjoy the game for what it is, but ill likely never beat it nor play for more than an hour at a time going forward.   The intro of the game before you're free to explore is about 2 hours, so make sure you really want this game because you will likely not be able to get a refund.",8,0.538922131061553955,76561199521472342,4.2,0

2025-01-27 18:00,55.2,推荐,"Probably one of the best games I have played in my life, hands down GOTY. I don't even know from where to  begin with, the story, the depth, the overall design of the world, enemies as well as characters?! Everything is top notch.  So basically, Black Myth Wukong is a souls-like boss rush game. At first I was kinda let down that this isn't a normal game, or even a normal souls-like. I felt like my ""stamina"" would drain after encountering so many bosses that need a lot of focus to beat. But oh boy was I mistaken? I never put the controller down due to tiresome, I was always coming back until I beat that freaking blue huge headed dude. The reason for that is creativity, and fair challenge. It never felt unfair to fight an enemy, no matter how much stronger he was. The world building and storytelling, along with some of the best and most interesting boss designs in gaming ever will make you to never want to quit. The game is linear with a lot of secrets to uncover per map, it never feels limited or empty, a new challenge always awaits in every corner. Developers seemed to know and understand what players truly want, this becomes even more apparent on the final battle of the true ending. There isn't a simple way to explain Wukong, the game has incredible depth in every aspect, that it would took me a lot of time to go into detail for each one of them, so just like I do with all my recent reviews, I will start pointing the pros and cons of it, to keep the review as readable as it can be.  [h2] PROS [/h2]  -Gameplay: Typical Souls-Like with a lot of spells and combos. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Enemy Design: There are like 100 different bosses I believe? along with another hundreds of normal enemies. All of them have out of this world design both mechanic and aesthetic wise. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Character Design: Well, monke, pig and other Chinese mythology characters, you can't go wrong. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Graphics: Breathtaking [u] 9/10 [/u] -World Design: Every map/world has its own theme, feels like different biomes (snow, desert, underground etc) [u] 9/10 [/u] -Story: Starts slow, ends in epicness, the more you play the more you get hooked in. [u] 10/10 [/u] -Audio/Sound Design: [u] Top notch/10 [/u] -Soundtrack: [u] Epic/10 [/u] -100% Achievement Difficulty: Easy [u] (10/10 [/u] -Game Length: Reflects its price [u] 10/10 [/u]  [h2] CONS [/h2] -Weird hitboxes in certain fights: Scropionlord is a nightmare due to broken hitboxes. -A lot of invisible walls in places they didn't need to be. I get it for nonreachable areas, but when they are in legit paths is just lazy, you could simply fill the room with loot instead, or enemies.  [u] Conclusion: [/u] One of the best and most enjoyable experiences a person can have in gaming, before I beat the final boss I was thinking how to write the review, so many words in my head, but I am just kinda speechless, the only thing I can say is this.. Buy it.  [u] Overall: [/u] [b] 9.5/10 [/b]",2,0.533073961734771729,76561198120305882,85.3,556

2024-10-01 05:38,118.4,推荐,"This game is great and worth getting even at full price but it isn't the 10/10 some people are making it out to be. It does some things great like the number of bosses and the variety in their attack styles but other things like the story and polish it falls short on.   [h3][b][u] Audio: 9/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  I played with the English voices and they sounded great, some of them have a British accent but it wasn't bad and I think the voices fit. The game has great surround sound and music. I have heard for the Chinese players there is music from a popular TV series from the 80s about the Journey to the West that a lot of them grew up on so that is a nice touch for them.   [h3][b][u] Graphics: 8.5/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  I have a 7900XT and played at 4K 60FPS. The game does look great when you stop to take in the surroundings but the game forces you to use upscaling which is a negative to me. I don't have DLSS so I am not sure how it looks in this game but having tested the other 3 available upscalers (FSR, TSR, XESS) they all have some drawbacks and are not as good as native. Setting the upscaler to 100 does not seem to set it to native. In the Benchmark tool they released before the full game it showed even at 100 there was different results between the 3 upscalers and in the full game if you turn on motion blur to strong and spin around you can still see ghosting around his head so the upscaling is still on. I am also pretty sure this is not FSR 3.1 which has the new upscaler so I would like to see that added at some point. Turning on Frame Gen with both FSR and TSR causes trees in some locations to constantly flicker when moving. I was able to hide this by turning motion blur on but I normally do not play with motion blur so that is kind of annoying but to minimize the visual issues upscaling causes it is needed in this game.   I eventually settled on leaving FSR to 50 with the Very High graphics preset to get a near constant 60FPS. Without the flickering from Frame Gen I only had to deal with the ghosting from upscaling but with motion blur set to weak I was able to hide it enough that It didn't bother me for the rest of the game. Outside of the upscaling issue the game looks amazing.  [h3][b][u] Story: 7/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  There are some translation errors but they have been fixing them overtime. The story however is the biggest issue I had with the game. It takes place after the Journey to the West so before buying the game I watched a several videos on the Journey to the West to have a frame of reference in the game. But even with that the story is presented in a way that you will probably be confused if you have not actually read the novel. A lot of the details that elevate a story to being great will be missed so you will need to find an explanation from someone online who has read the novel to fully appreciate the story. The game is definitely made with the expectation you know the Journey to the West novel well. The game does try to add some back story on characters through journal entries you get from beating enemies but I would say the majority of them were just random tales or poetry that while interesting were not relevant to the main story. Some definitely did explain more about the major characters and the story but those were still not enough in my opinion.   After you beat a chapter you unlock a mural of events relevant to that chapter. If you zoom in you will find the option to click on parts of it and a narrator will give some brief dialogue that does help but if you don't zoom it's easy to skip past it and never get the dialogue. The dialogue there is usually helpful but they are brief and leave you wanting more. With all the effort they put into the mostly irrelevant journal entries I think it would have been better to reduce the journal entries and instead have a small detailed recap of the parts of the Journey to the West that chapter is based on before or after a chapter.   There are 6 chapters in total and after each chapter there is a cool animated video but they have little dialogue and the stories can seem out of place. Sometimes the story is in reference to the main story of the chapter you just finished so you understand what it's about but other times it's about a side story in the upcoming chapter so you have no idea what it was about. If you read the novel though you will recognize the character and have an idea of what is coming up. It's possible in the one where it references a side story for you to miss it in the chapter and then be even more confused about what the previous video was about since the character never appeared. In other cases the video references something that happened in the previous chapter but the characters are in another form so you have no idea who it is unless you read the novel and make the connection.  It's a shame because there is a really good story here with great characters and acting but it feels like a lot of the time the characters aren't given enough time to have the impact they could have because the story is told with the expectation of you knowing the backstory already. Now all that said if you don't mind having to go read a bunch of forum posts or read the book the story in the game is actually pretty interesting and the secret/true ending hints at what the DLC should be about.  [h3][b][u] Game Play: 7.5/10 [/u][/b][/h3]  I have seen some people say it's too hard and others it's too easy. I would say the difficulty is closer to God of War and  the Souls games are harder. The game does a great job of making it feel like an actual journey though. You start off weak and the game makes you learn the mechanics early on or you won't be able to beat the boss. As I gained new abilities the following chapters felt easier overall. I had the most deaths in Chapter 1 as I was learning but after that the number of tries I needed to beat a boss dropped significantly. In the later chapters they raise the difficulty again so it doesn't get too easy. NG+ is done really well too because the best items are only in NG+ so there is an actual reason to do NG+ and it's satisfying to destroy early bosses.  There are over 100 bosses and most have different fighting styles and don't use unfair moves that insta kill. The combat is fun and can be mixed up as you get multiple spells, transformations, staff stances, and weapons. But there are some bugs and things the game does not explain. Sometimes your character just won't dodge or use an item in the middle of a fight. Sometimes this is due to status effects like being shocked but the game never explains the effects of these statuses so a lot of people think the combat is laggy. Other times it is due to input lag or a bug. I have tested it out with my controller and seen outside of fights there is sometimes noticeable input lag. I was able to fix it by restarting the game but if it starts in the middle of a fight you are stuck with it as changing the controller didn't help.   Level design is mostly linear but I like it because it's more curated so you get a better experience. Even though it is linear there is still a lot to explore. I never had an issue with the invisible walls like some of these people claim. It never broke the atmosphere for me and 99% of the time I could tell where a wall was. The worst area for me was the open world chapter because it is mostly empty so I had to waste time exploring a boring area. There is a snow chapter that is semi open world and it was the second worst area because it was a pain to explore. That chapter is also the one most people have performance issues on due to size and snow. Outside of 1 area the environment is not an obstacle like in Souls games but the camera can mess you up sometimes.   Even with those issues it's still a great game that I recommend and I can't wait for the DLC.

When I started it was actually pretty cool, the cut scenes were sick and the story was intriguing. However after only two hours of playing the game I instantly got bored of repeatedly just pressing x and going to boss fight after boss fight. The skill tree was terrible and the game wouldn't even give you upgraded gear to fight new bosses or a weapon as the stick is the only weapon you get in the game. For me personally I think fighting a boss should be more of a special occurrence and not something to be fighting every ten minutes like it is in this game. The combat system was also very rigid and the hit boxes were terrible, I would be there just spamming the button to dodge and it would only work 50% of the time. Also the heavy attacks are so poorly optimized with the combat system which led me to use light attacks on bosses who were barely affected. I understand people like games where you just hop from boss to boss for who knows how long but for me this game just wasn't enjoyable.",14,0.53033369779586792,76561198972432487,1.5,0

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).  The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.  Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end).   Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.  8.5/10",1,0.525862038135528564,76561198151665307,152.8,0

2025-03-21 21:24,53.5,推荐,"The GOAT of Action RPGs – Black Myth: Wukong  As someone who has watched Journey to the West countless times and read the novel from cover to cover, I can confidently say Black Myth: Wukong is the best adaptation of the legendary tale I’ve ever seen. This game beautifully blends the mythological world of Sun Wukong with modern action RPG gameplay, and it’s a masterpiece in almost every sense.  Story The narrative is one of the game's standout features. Drawing deep inspiration from Journey to the West, Black Myth: Wukong manages to keep the essence of the ancient legend while making it accessible and thrilling for modern audiences. The story feels grounded, emotional, and, at times, profoundly philosophical, delving into themes of rebellion, enlightenment, and destiny. Sun Wukong's journey—his rise to power, his fall from grace, and his quest for redemption—is masterfully captured, and you genuinely feel the weight of his character arc.  Graphics Visually, this game is a showstopper. From the lush forests and vast landscapes to the awe-inspiring bosses and magical creatures, the art direction is nothing short of breathtaking. The level of detail in every scene, from the fluidity of combat animations to the epic scale of the environments, is staggering. Each new area feels like a new world to explore, each more beautiful and intricate than the last. If you enjoy games that offer a rich, immersive world to lose yourself in, Black Myth: Wukong will definitely satisfy your hunger for visual grandeur.  Chinese Dub For me, the cherry on top is the Chinese dub. The voice acting feels so authentic, bringing an added layer of immersion to the game. Wukong’s voice actor captures the mischievous and rebellious spirit of the Monkey King perfectly. There’s something deeply satisfying about hearing the dialogues in the original language, which truly enhances the experience of being transported into ancient China. It’s a treat for anyone who appreciates the cultural authenticity of the story.  Music The soundtrack is phenomenal. From sweeping orchestral pieces during epic battles to more serene and contemplative tracks that accompany moments of reflection, the music matches the mood perfectly. The score beautifully blends traditional Chinese instruments with modern orchestral arrangements, creating a soundscape that feels both timeless and grand. It adds emotional depth to the narrative and enhances the overall atmosphere of the game.  Dismiss the Naysayers Now, to address a small but vocal group of people who seem hell-bent on tearing this game down because it’s not ""woke"" enough—honestly, it's disappointing. Black Myth: Wukong is a game deeply rooted in Chinese mythology and culture, and the developers have stayed true to that vision. If you’re coming into the game expecting some forced, politically correct take on an ancient legend, this isn’t the game for you. The Monkey King’s story isn’t about pandering to modern sensibilities; it’s about growth, power, rebellion, and wisdom in a world full of danger and mysticism. Let the game be what it is, and don’t drag it down with misguided critiques. This game deserves to be celebrated for what it brings to the table: a stunning reimagining of a beloved myth, an engaging story, and a thrilling action RPG experience.  Final Thoughts Black Myth: Wukong isn’t just a game; it’s an experience—a celebration of Chinese mythology, culture, and storytelling. Whether you're a fan of Journey to the West or just someone who loves a great action RPG, this game should be on your radar. Stunning visuals, a gripping story, excellent voice work, and an incredible soundtrack combine to make Black Myth: Wukong a true standout in the genre. It’s a must-play.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198090409385,53.5,0

2025-03-12 18:34,37.0,推荐,"Black Myth: Wukong is a cinematic masterpiece. This game has everything that I want gameplay-wise on a souls-like game, without being a ""true"" souls-like, because tbh its more similar to God of War PS4 all things considered. But anyway, if you're looking for a good story-rich game with fun gameplay BM:W will not disappoint. My only gripe with the game is that I feel the difficulty is kinda too easy, and some levels are very annoying to traverse, but its not enough to bring the game down. I'll breakdown my thoughts more down below, but TLDR:  10/10 peak game, a perfect experience overall, would smash yaoguais with my stick again.  Story & Worldbuilding: 10/10 I've never really had any interest in Chinese myth before, but after playing this game I literally read the entire original Journey to the West novel just so I can ""get"" the references in the game. The game's story and world feels like a love letter, a celebration of all aspect of Chinese mythology both ancient and new interpretations mixed with truly phenomenal original writing from the devs. I really like how the story feels like it keeps escalating again and again until Wukong- welp it's gonna be a huge spoiler if I continue, so just experience it for yourself. I guarantee, no matter how high your expectation is, its still going to blow your mind all the same.  Gameplay: 10/10 Gameplay is solid... nah who am I kidding, its perfect. We have the usual stuff like dodge roll, camera lock on, light and heavy attacks, jumps, etc., alongside fresh new take on the skill tree system. You can re-spec your skills at any point in the game which is HUGE for build variety and replayabillity. And speaking of build variety, there are a plethora of builds you can try with 3 distinctly different stances: Smash, Pillar, and Thrust.  We also have several spells that are unique and build-defining, alongside an enormous library of transformations to chose from. Also all the armor sets have set bonuses like in Monster Hunter, and all of them, yes ALL of them, enables completely unique builds. Its just a shame that some builds are CLEARLY way better than others though, so there's not really much reason to play them aside for wanting to challenge yourself. Now with all these combinations of spells and equipments, you can definitely live out your fantasy of become lore accurate Sun Wukong. Its just a bit of a shame that the bosses are quite easy, they won't really halt your progress for longer than 30-60 minutes at best until you learn how to beat them. But don't be mistaken, some particularly special bosses are still sufficiently difficult, warranting you to ""get good"" in order to beat them but they are way too few and far between. But I guess that's not really a problem because the lore for the bosses are pretty good and that fact carried the experience for me.   Sound & Music: 10/10 Its peak. It goes insanely hard almost every single time I don't know how they keep doing it. Sounds design was on point as well, I particularly really like the sound that The Destined One's staff makes when bonking people around and the sound of perfect dodges, like fr its super satisfying.   Environment & Level Design: 8/10 Oh it takes a LOT to render the environment alright, and was it worth it? yeah 100%. The game looks BEAUTIFUL. Every level are so artisticly crafted, every monument treated with immense detail and care, and everything is just so beautifully sculptured, like literally every corner you turn to, it looks good. BUT the level design? nahhhh I see what the level designers are trying to do but they're not cooking for real. I get that they're going for the ""larger than life"" type of feel but man some of these areas are just way too empty, and some areas are too annoying to traverse through because 1. The layout is just not that good, and the map is confusing at times and 2. Sometimes its kinda unclear where they want you to go. But most levels are good and also they got the whole ""connected area"" thing with shortcuts and unlockables which I really dig it so its still pretty good all things considered.  Aight thats it, I dont want the review to be too long, just wanna share my thoughts after completing the game for the first time.

2025-02-22 06:00,56.8,推荐,"[h1]Black Myth: Wukong — A Revolutionary Ode to Eastern Mythology [/h1]  [h2] Introduction[/h2] In an era where gaming constantly pushes boundaries of storytelling and technology, Black Myth: Wukong emerges as a thunderous declaration of China's cultural renaissance in the digital age. Developed by Game Science, this action RPG reimagines the legendary Journey to the West with breathtaking ambition, blending mythic grandeur with cutting-edge artistry. It is not merely a game—it is a pilgrimage through a world where every frame whispers ancient secrets, and every battle roars with the spirit of rebellion.  [h3]1. A Visual Masterpiece Rooted in Tradition [/h3] Black Myth: Wukong stuns with its painterly landscapes, where mist-shrouded mountains and crumbling temples evoke classical Chinese ink-wash paintings brought to life. Using Unreal Engine 5, the game transforms folklore into visceral reality: fur on the Monkey King’s armor sways with uncanny realism; rain slicks the scales of towering dragon bosses; and crumbling statues of forgotten gods seem to bleed centuries of sorrow. This is not just graphical prowess—it’s a love letter to China’s artistic heritage, proving that ""next-gen"" can coexist with timeless aesthetics.  [h3]2. Combat: Poetry in Motion [/h3] The game’s combat system dances between brutality and grace. Wukong’s staff strikes carry the weight of a thousand grudges, yet flow like calligraphy strokes—each dodge, parry, and transformation (into cicadas, giant apes, or spectral forms) feels like unlocking verses from an ancient martial arts manual. Boss battles ascend to operatic heights: imagine dueling a four-faced Buddhist colossus amid falling cherry blossoms, or outwitting a shapeshifting fox spirit whose laughter echoes through a moonlit graveyard. Unlike many soulslikes, Wukong rewards cunning as much as reflexes, weaving Taoist philosophy into its gameplay DNA.  [h3]3. Subverting Expectations, Honoring Legacy [/h3] While drawing from Wu Cheng’en’s 16th-century epic, Black Myth boldly reinterprets its characters. This Sun Wukong is no mere trickster—he’s a weary warrior haunted by celestial betrayals. Side characters like the Pig Demon and Spider Queen receive Shakespearean depth, their tragedies mirroring themes of karma and redemption. Environmental storytelling thrives: a shattered prayer bell might hint at a god’s fall from grace; bloodstained scrolls recount battles lost to time. This isn’t cultural appropriation—it’s cultural resurrection.  [h3]4. Soundscape: Where Myth Meets Metal [/h3] The soundtrack merges guqin melodies with thunderous percussion, while voice acting (in classical Chinese dialects) lends gravitas to every deity and demon. Combat sounds are visceral—the crack of a staff breaking armor, the otherworldly shrieks of underworld creatures—yet never drown out subtle details: the rustle of bamboo forests, the chime of distant temple bells. It’s an acoustic tapestry that bridges past and present.  [h3]5. A Watershed Moment for Global Gaming [/h3] Beyond its technical triumphs, Black Myth: Wukong challenges the West-centric gaming narrative. Its success proves that stories rooted in non-Western mythologies can resonate globally when told with authenticity and audacity. Early sales smashing records worldwide (including 10 million copies in 3 days) aren’t just numbers—they’re a roar from audiences hungry for new perspectives. As the gaming industry grapples with homogenization, this title stands as a beacon: true innovation often lies in rediscovering what others have forgotten.  [h2] Conclusion[/h2] Black Myth: Wukong is more than a game—it’s a cultural exorcism. It confronts the ghosts of colonial-era erasure, wielding Sun Wukong’s staff not just as a weapon, but as a brush painting China’s myths onto the global consciousness. For players, it offers an unforgettable journey; for developers, a masterclass in balancing tradition with innovation. As the credits roll, one truth becomes clear: the Monkey King has finally broken free from the pages of history—and the gaming world will never be the same.",2,0.523809552192687988,76561198835452838,56.8,0
