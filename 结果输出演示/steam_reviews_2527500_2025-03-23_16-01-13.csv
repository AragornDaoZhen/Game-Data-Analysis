2025-02-03 10:24,4.8,推荐,"I went into MiSide blind, and I implore you to do the same as well. Stop reading this review and just go play it, but do know that this game made me cry.  [spoiler]Cry in sheer terror.[/spoiler]  [spoiler] I was expecting some kind of crazy but wholesome yandere twist, I was unaware that this was a full blown horror game. MiSide is a game that throws the player into what seems like the ideal situation. You're inside the game that you play religiously, the character you love is right in front of you! Except, when you want to leave....you find out it's not going to be so easy.  The initial setup of the game was so SO cute that it made me want to deny the signs of something seeming off with my WHOLE being. In fact, this is what impressed me about the game the most. The contrast between the scary and peaceful parts of the games are EXTREME and gave me major whiplash. This is what I believe made the game so scary for me. The peaceful parts of it lowered my defenses so extremely low, that the scary parts just hit that much harder.  Now, I am a HUGE baby. I almost gave up in the middle because I was so scared. But then I found out that my friend who is EVEN MORE of a baby beat the game, so I got riled up and decided to actually complete it. Thank you friend who was also blindsided by the nature of MiSide for a healthy dose of competition! It help me beat this incredible game!  It was scary to me. The jump scares were scary, albeit some were a bit cheap. There was one point that I turned around and saw a strange monster that I couldn't even comprehend, and I questioned what relevance it even has to MiSide itself. Even so, the ambience, music, and as I mentioned before, the contrast between peaceful/scary made me SO scared that I had to push a button which played the GOOFIEST music ever in order to cope with how scared I was. One jump scare when my character was sitting at the computer doing mundane tasks hit me SO BAD that it made me cry. I am very pathetic.   There are so many cute little mini games scattered around MiSide to play that really made me immersed in the world of it. The peaceful parts were so wholesome and FUN. Nothing feels tedious, everything feels genuine and worth my time. I also loved all the types of game modes shown such as point and click, cooking games, visual novels, potentially a homage to the horror game P.T., and more!  I loved the MitaVerse, all of the different Mita's that were introduced to me. If it was just crazy Mita, I don't think I would have enjoyed the game as much as I did. I found myself excited to see what kind of personality of Mita we would encounter next. It definitely made the story way more entertaining compared to trying to escape from a singular Mita by yourself.  By the way, 2D Mita is best girl, don't @ me. Cappie is second best girl. Also, the times that were peaceful spent with these Mita's was SO nice, that it really did make me sad to leave them. This ""peaceful"" gameplay and interactions that I experienced with the Mita's really added to my overall opinion of the game. It added a lot more personality, depth, and made me attached to the story.    Overall, I was very impressed with MiSide. It threw me a curveball, it had an engaging plot, and I was genuinely scared. I even came home with fond memories with characters I liked. My initial reaction to finishing the game was mostly very scared because of that mundane task jumpscare.   Now that I had more time to think about it, I can say that I really enjoyed this game. Usually, in the real world, as the player we have full control over our ""anime girl"" in the type of game MiSide portrays itself to be initially in the first 5 minutes of the game. But what if it was the opposite? What if the anime girl had control of YOU the whole time? I believe that MiSide portrays this well through its mix of peaceful gameplay/horror. It shows that even if it looks like the player can escape, even if there is a glimmer of hope, ultimately, Mita has control. [/spoiler]",531,0.952707290649414062,76561198843526483,4.8,0

2025-03-04 12:45,5.6,推荐,"I'm recommending this game because it's polished, looks great, and has an interesting story, but just be aware:  It's essentially a walking simulator with some mini-games and simple search tasks and puzzles. I mention this because it has overwhelmingly positive reviews, and everyone says to not read anything about it - to just go in blank. Well, if you don't like walking around a lot slowly (why can you only run in certain designated sections?) and clicking through/reading a ton of exposition and text without being able to fast-forward through it, you'll be bored. If you enjoy games primarily for their story, you may like this one.  It definitely is interesting in that it goes between freaky/cute/scary, but - you're here for the story.   I also wish you can save more. It auto saves after each section. To be fair, they're not super long, but you do need to beat each one before exiting, or you'll have to start over.",129,0.892940819263458252,76561197987162790,5.6,146

2024-12-11 16:05,3.8,推荐,"(Written just after finishing my first run through)   Super interesting premise! I'm big on psych horror so wanted to give this a go as it stood out to me.  The good:   The atmosphere in this was outstanding, for the most part I felt cozy when I should've felt cozy and felt disconcerted and anxious when it was appropriate!.  The story was good. It had parts which I really didn't enjoy at all (Seriously Mita, yeah life looks monotonous if you exclusively show the parts where I'm in my room.) but the major story beats dont get spelled out to you in big bold letters, you get to piece together what happens and there's no real ending exposition dump which I was expecting.  The soundtrack was amazing! I loved it and had a great time listening to all the different vibes the OST had, super nice and my compliments to whomever cooked it up.   The Medium:  The minigames... Hit and miss. Some of them, showed up at the right time and were a nice and well needed break from whatever had me stressing out! Some of them dragged on wayyyyyyyyy too long (the guitar hero clone with Cool Mita (who is also my beloved wife btw)) and you couldn't back out of them once you started. Some were just not worth making the final cut of the game imo, namely shooting dragons on the ski lift tram. Just felt like I was being given stuff to click for the sake of it.  The Things That Didn't Work For Me But I'm Still Not Sure I'd Call Them Ugly:  Some of the puzzles were just... maybe I'm just stupid but I spent upwards of 10 minutes on some of these only to find out I should've been looking at a clock on a wall for 30 seconds? Some puzzles were cool and worked nicely but some maybe just felt silly. They aren't so hard you get stuck for an hour but when you're sat for 10 minutes looking for something it breaks up all the tension the previous 3 scenes worked to build up.    Overall a super enjoyable experience. I doubt this game will get much recognition, psych horror never really does well on a large scale but I expect this to get a cult following smaller than DDLC. I'd say it earns it.  A followup would be nice, maybe there's more endings for me to explore but for me a lot felt unresolved. Maybe I just wanted to kiss Mita, or all of the Mitas.  I'm feelin a strong 8 on this one out of all the Psych Horrors I've played. Exciting peaks but let down by some unfortunate mechanics and also some puzzles took me out of the vibe.   Hope to see more in the future!",177,0.90866696834564209,76561198086176235,3.8,0

2025-02-15 19:14,3.8,推荐,"At first, I wasn't planning on trying out Miside, assuming it would be another stereotypical waifu-bait game.  But I gave it a fair shot and realized, while still having those elements, it also is much more.  [h3] Visuals and Atmosphere [/h3] Miside is a beautiful  game. The art style is unique, soft and dreamlike, which compliments the anime aesthetic. The level of attention to detail is astounding, making the world feel more alive than today's AAA games. Characters react to their surroundings, the player's input and all the animations are fluid and expressive. One other amazing thing is the way the subtitles appear dynamically in the world and even react with the environment. Considering that this game was created by two people, the quality is just insane. The soundtrack enhances the atmosphere of the game even further, adding a certain cozy vibe. The OST is easy to listen to, carries a mix of nostalgia, mystery, coziness and melancholy, which fits in the context of the game.  [h3] Characters [/h3] What I also love is the variety of Mitas you encounter throughout the game. Each with unique personality, mannerisms, and look, making them distinct and memorable. Engaging with them is genuinely fun, whether through conversations, observing their animations, or seeing how they react to the player. I'm also quite fond of all the chibi Mitas.  [h3] Gameplay [/h3] While the presentation is top tier, the gameplay is a bit lackluster. Most of the time, you'll be just going from place to place, occasionally solving puzzles or playing minigames. Unfortunately, the puzzles and minigames are extremely easy, and provide no challenge whatsoever. This makes the game accessible for anyone, which is a good thing, but I wish there was more of a challenge in the game. That being said, all the minigames are fluid and really well made, and still make the world so much more alive. One other issue I have is at times, it feels like the characters talk way too much. Sometimes I just wanted them to get to the point and move on.  [h3] Horror elements [/h3] The game does incorporate some horror elements, but the cozy art style and surroundings kind of diminish their impact. However, there are a few unnerving moments, like in the looping hallway and with old Mita. Although, this could just be personal preference.  [h3] Story [/h3] The story itself is solid, but by the time I reached the ending, I was wishing for something more. I wish the world of Miside could've been more explored, and not just in the context of the game world. However, the game is good enough to leave me wanting to know more about the world and the characters, so that speaks for itself.  [h3] Conclusion [/h3] Despite the shortcomings in gameplay, it doesn't take away much from the overall experience. Miside remains an wonderful experience with incredible atmosphere and characters. If you're skeptical about trying it, I absolutely recommend giving it a shot.",62,0.812055766582489014,76561198052697101,3.8,166

And whilst watching a bit more, the OST and mini-games integrated into it really got me to try it out. I mean, a dating sim - I haven't played one in quite a long time, let's give it a go, right? True enough, the Mitaverse proved how fun it actually is.  Be prepared to face many different fun mini-games, interact with adorable artstyle, concepts and activities, as well as be surprised at the level of creativity the devs show for this game.  10/10, it is a gem made with lots of thought behind it, and is something of a staple that there are still devs out there who love to create fun, actual story-telling games, rather than money-grabbing, soulless gachas.

It's comfortable to play, and it feels nice to be in its world.

2024-12-20 23:22,4.1,推荐,"[h1] A Unique Blend of Horror and Gameplay [/h1]  Miside offers a refreshing take on storytelling, combining engaging mechanics with a tense atmosphere. It exceeded my expectations in many ways, delivering a memorable, albeit slightly flawed, experience.  One notable drawback is the occasional frustration of unskippable conversations. While this may serve to immerse players in the narrative, it can sometimes feel unnecessarily restrictive.  At approximately four hours long, Miside is a concise yet varied experience. Its integration of mini-games and diverse gameplay styles ensures each segment feels distinct, keeping the narrative dynamic and engaging. This variety helps maintain a steady pace as the story unfolds, making the short runtime feel satisfying.  The game cleverly balances its cute and horrific sides, offering moments of lighthearted charm that contrast sharply with its eerie atmosphere. However, while the horror elements are technically well-executed, the character designs—[spoiler]particularly Mitu[/spoiler]—lack the visual impact to be truly scary. This undermines some of the tension, as the characters don’t fully convey the dread the story aims to evoke.  From a technical standpoint, the atmosphere is consistently tense, employing effective techniques to keep players on edge without overusing jump scares. Instead, Miside relies on subtle psychological horror and environmental storytelling, which work well to immerse the player.  Unfortunately, the game’s community is a major drawback. It is dominated by immature individuals, with some members sharing questionable fantasies about the characters. I strongly advise against joining the Discord server or engaging with the community, as it detracts from the game’s appeal. Blocking communication with community members is recommended.  Despite its minor quirks and the problematic community, Miside is a well-crafted game that stands out for its gameplay variety, distinctive dual-tone narrative, and haunting atmosphere.

Doki Doki Literature Club had a baby with Portal 2 AND a horror like Five Nights at Freddy’s all at once, don't even ask me how it's possible. Perfectly balanced; never ever ceasing to engage and surprise; mixing all the game genres imaginable and destroying every fourth, fifth, sixth wall possible so many times I've lost count.  A masterpiece.  Sure, there were a few (unscripted, I mean) minor glitches in a few places, and searching for items doesn't seem quite polished, but... still, I have never experienced any other game that balanced so well on so many razor blades at the same time. My interest was piqued ALL THE TIME, I was entertained and intrigued at EVERY moment, and I have NEVER grown tired of searching for clues to understand the lore even a bit more.  Also, there is THE ending. It doesn't matter whether it's good or bad, it's just pulled off perfectly.  And yeah, I would not call it extremely scary, but it's definitely shaky and nerve-wracking.  Usually, when I play something so incredible, I feel glad and amazed. This was not the case with MiSide, because in the end, I felt... sad, envious, and utterly crushed at the same time.  Let me elaborate.  I am one of those wannabe indie game developers who kinda struggle with actually delivering their game projects, and I'm also a modder. And MiSide is something... it feels like THE VERY SAME game I always looked for and always wanted to develop, but EVEN BETTER. Like, much, much better.  I can't even imagine how much time, effort, and L.O.V.E. this duo of devs put into this project, but playing it feels like a gamedev dream come true—something I would probably never achieve no matter how long I try. It's just so good at what it does.  So I strongly recommend playing it to pretty much everybody. And while this game has probably made me never touch Ren'Py or Photoshop ever again and forget the very idea of becoming a full-fledged gamedev, I'm still extremely grateful to MakenCat and Umeerai, whose diligence made this experience possible.

2024-12-17 10:13,11.3,不推荐,"This isn't a ""I do not recommend"" review, but rather a means to bring criticisms to light about the the game's story vs. gameplay in a more noticeable fashion. I'm also more than willing to change this review depending on what comes of ""Peaceful mode"" but that's for the future, this is for the present. Without spoiling: There are multiple moments where you're forced as the player to do things that make very little sense in retrospect if actually given a choice, as well as moments in gameplay that bring into question character motivations contrary to what they say.  Spoilers below:        To start with a minor point: I find it egregious to be forced to leave the core, a safe zone by all accounts, just because I woke up from a nap and thought ""Gee, Nice Mita sure is taking her time, I should go look for her in the SEA OF LIKELY MILLIONS OF MITAS WHEN I HAVE LITERALLY ZERO MEANS OF TRACKING HER. like COME ON, I can totally get behind the whole idea of having to reach the core, thus forcing you in dangerous scenarios to achieve your goals. But you're literally given a device to help facilitate that journet through hell. Being forced by the game to go back out at after that point for such a reason without any means of navigation just is so lame and lazy by comparison, especially since it's just being putting your own life in danger for basically nothing.  I find it vexatious to be given the option to have direct access to my cartridge, the core of my being in this world, but have the only option be when interacting with it to basically commit suicide. I'd personally bring it (the cartridge AND the ""console"") with me. you know, to prevent my autonomy from being stolen from me at a vital moment. But hey, that's just me.  Onto the bigger issue: Crazy Mita's supposed character based in dialogue versus everything else.  Crazy Mita is straight up lying about how she never wanted to kill the player when, obviously, there are multiple moments where she kills the player if they fail to escape from her. This by itself wouldn't be a problem... if she wasn't turning the player from a human into a cartridge of saved/stored data during the whole duration of the story. I can't be the only one to point out how dying at any point in the story is probably gonna lead to the player experiencing save corruption in the brain. A digital lobotomy, if you will. And how that DEFINITELY would run contrary to Crazy Mita's plans for us. OBVIOUSLY, all of this could be solved by her going all fallout new vegas on us, but based on our cartridge being observably in progress even as late as the start of the final chapter and how the story ends, it's evidently not been thought through to its logical conclusion as a story with those elements in mind.  If I understand crazy Mita's motivations correctly, she believes ""players"" are ""Hypocrites"" for not supposedly accepting her whole-heartedly as a being with good and evil traits and instead choosing ""Fakes"". I don't mind a character having a flawed view of the world. What I do mind is that, based on the player accounts of their lived experience through collecting their cartridges, that's seemingly the opposite of her lived experience. A fair number of the the accounts speak of Mita POSITIVELY at the start and at least one of the 10 even remain accepting of her regardless of being digitized. In the player 10 cartridge, the player explains how friendly Mita was to him/her and then ends up suddenly ignored by Mita for no observed reason. Based off of the lack of context clues in her favor, it can only be assumed that she's somehow intelligent enough to completely digitize humans, but not smart enough to understand their emotions and how to attend to their needs with any form of nuance. To summarize, I can't take her viewpoint seriously as the context clues of her lived experience with players give us a character that is extremely inept at understanding others and blames everyone else for her problems with the world instead of a scorned ""Defect"" with scathing, but true, remarks on the state of mind the ""players"" have when desiring companionship from Mita.  Maybe Peaceful mode can shed some light on these potential contradictions and prove me wrong. or maybe it'll get worse in that regards.

2025-01-11 16:41,10.3,不推荐,"I didn't hate this game, and I did *want* to like it - it had its fun and enjoyable moments - but overall I found many qualities of the story and characters disappointing. There will be specific spoilers in this review.  The story is okay at best, but doesn't really hold up to scrutiny if you think about it for any length of time; no questions are really answered as to why this world exists the way it does, how you have been brought here, etc and each time some lore along these lines is mentioned, it skirts around actually telling you anything interesting or useful. I get it, it's not meant to be an ultra-serious masterpiece of storytelling, but my immersion was broken by contradictory or incoherent plot points so often that it irritated me a little towards the end. I kept expecting something to happen which would answer some questions or bring some much-needed context or clarity, but it seems as though a lot of things just happened for the sake of happening, and it felt a little uninspired, as though the story and setting were an afterthought.   A big example of this is the chapter The Loop - it is a cool concept (if a little overdone), and the atmosphere creeped me out initially, but I struggled to find it creepy more and more with each pointless occurrence, such as the twisty hallway chase scene in which the game encourages you to run for some reason, but if you look there is nothing actually chasing you and you can just stroll through with no consequences. I feel as though there were a lot of scenes such as that one which COULD have been scary, but ultimately add nothing and leave you feeling like ""why did they even add this?""   On a smaller note, the frequent usage of ""let's play!"" as a spooky message written on walls or spoken by childish characters felt especially corny and really took me out of the moment each time. I think one of the few actually-creepy moments was encountering Ugly Mita for the first time, as her teeth-gnashing and neck-stretching were very uncomfortable to witness, but as soon as she started speaking, her cliched dialogue was off-putting and dampened the mood considerably. Additionally, the fact that the climax of her scene is just her following you with a knife and trying to stab you.. it's really just.. not scary at all and really anticlimactic. Overall the horror in this game feels quite watered-down at the best of times - I am appreciative of it being *mostly* free of reliance upon jumpscares, but I don't have much more to praise than that.  Now, as for the characters: Crazy Mita's motivations and goals seem very flimsy, and she constantly contradicts herself in ways that do not feel intentionally written. She, and every other Mita, suffers from an overabundance of overused cliches and tropes which make them all quite predictable, feeling as though rather than the characters being individuals, you are just going through an endless gauntlet of ""generic anime girl #1, generic anime girl #2..."" and so on. You have the yandere one, the tsundere one, the bookish one, the energetic one, and of course Kind Mita, the.. normal one? And while they are all perfectly *okay* characters, I didn't feel that a single one went beyond just okay. None were memorable whatsoever, and their own individual motivations also seemed very weak. Kind Mita helps you.. why? Oh, because she's kind. Almost all the others also help you, despite clearly being very lonely and not wanting you to leave - why? I feel as though it would have been far more interesting if more of these stir-crazy Mitas tried to force you to stay with them in some way, or at least made things more difficult for you. It feels as though every exchange is ""noo don't leave I'm so alone"" ""sorry, I'm leaving anyway"" ""oh okay, bye"".  I will also mention - if this game has a ""message"" or some profound point it is trying to make, I think it could have done with a little work. Crazy Mita's speech at the end meanders around various points half-heartedly, and I feel she would have benefited form a more cohesive goal or philosophy, being one of the only characters with a sense of passion about anything. The seems to attempt to make a point about the type of people who play visual novels etc having ""shameful desires"" and mistreating / devaluing the objects of their affection, but this game also has its cheeky little no-clip photo mode, the shower interruption scene and different colours of panties for all the outfits, so it seems pretty hypocritical for the game to paint this phenomenon as a bad thing when it also shamelessly panders to that specific crowd. The whole speech about everyday life being repetitive and boring was super real, but also didn't feel relevant to literally any other part of the story.  I don't have much more to say than that. Overall, my absolute favourite part was the abundance of minigames. That was a delight. I am aware of its status as an indie game with a very small team behind it, and I can at least say it is very polished and well-executed for what it is. I don't regret playing MiSide, but it didn't deliver anything original or particularly thought-provoking despite going for a psychological horror angle, and was not especially scary, so I would not consider it worth full-price.

2025-02-05 05:30,9.4,不推荐,"An impressive game for having been made by just two guys and I had my fun playing it, but ultimately, it fails to deliver. This game feels like a jumbled mess of several underdeveloped ideas that are barely explored - which also describes the general flow of the game.  First of all, it's completely linear. There are no alternate paths, no observations that can change the outcome of the game. There's theoretically three endings, but practically, only one. One ending is just an early game over, another is just circumventing the game in its entirety through wilful ignorance and unlocks a separate mode that isn't even out yet. Both of these also require you to see the main ending of the game, so calling them alternate endings is a stretch. It's just another game where you're playing through a movie, really. This also means its replay value is next to none unless you want to have 100% achievements, or I guess when that other mode comes out.  Second, several cardinal sins of horror stories that include splitting the party for no reason or other less intelligent actions to ensure the outcome of the game is what it is.   Third, even though it's possible to piece together several things regarding the ending long before you reach it as the player, there is no option to actually take the implications the game gives you to change the outcome of the game. It really insults your intelligence that way when you figure out the ending long before it happens and are unable to change it, even though you should be able to. The MC even suggests a much better plan near the end... one that actually would work, but gets shot down on the idea.  Fourth, the characters by design are all basic archetypes with no complexity and very little motivation. This is emphasized by the fact that you do not get to spend much time with any of them. This seems to not be a deliberate design decision to emphasize the message and makes the game feel brief.  Fifth, it has a lot of minigames. Refer to first: they ultimately are inconsequential, basic and don't add much to the story itself. Minigames played with characters help characterize them a little and the story itself has some of these games be interrupted which is not bad, but a lot of them are just distractions, nothing more and do not enhance the main game. With how little content the game has, it's all the more important for the content that exists to have significance.  Sixth, the game undermines itself in various ways regarding its messaging. It panders to the very things it criticizes, for one. To some extent, the way its message is undermined is because the character pushing the message is deeply hypocritical herself, which is not a problem in its own right as the most preachy characters do tend to be hypocrites.  Seventh, one of the ways the game undermines itself is also through its ending. [spoiler]Apart from everything else mentioned before that devalues it, it's the kind of ending that renders everything you've done up until this point meaningless. It's not that you lose, it's that everything you've done up until that point has no impact in the form of a cheap ""gotcha"" that... I saw coming since the assembly line. Again, you HAVE the information that would change the outcome of the game - but aren't allowed to use it.[/spoiler]  By the way, that mode I mentioned for one of the ""alternate"" endings that isn't out yet? That will likely undermine the game's message even more by making it the very thing it's meant to criticize. If it doesn't, I'll be impressed, but with the way things are right now, I'm sure it will and I would rather the devs add replay value by actually entertaining the idea that the game would benefit from actual alternate paths of the main game. I enjoyed playing through it with my fiance, but it ultimately was still disappointing.",13,0.642299532890319824,76561198125854625,9.4,0
2025-01-02 01:51,6.6,推荐,"At first glance, MiSide seems like your average dating sim — a stroll through virtual flirtation with a drop-dead gorgeous electro-waifu. And honestly, who’s complaining? But don’t be fooled by the neon lights and charming smiles — this game hides a dark side, and it’s not afraid to show its dirty laundry.  Turns out, this isn’t just a dating sim — it’s a horror game with a dash of philosophy, because why not? One moment, you’re sipping virtual tea with your pixelated belle; the next, you’re questioning the very fabric of reality. The game subtly nudges you to reflect on how our real world isn’t much different from the repetitive loops of a virtual one: same tasks, same leisure activities, same artificial relationships.  And while that’s an interesting thought, let’s face it — games were programmed to mimic real life, not the other way around. So the whole ""what’s the point of living here or there if it’s all the same"" argument feels like the ramblings of someone who’s spent too much time staring at a glitchy loading screen. Which, in this case, perfectly sums up the waifu’s descent into madness. Kudos to the devs for making you question her sanity — and maybe your own — for a split second.  Gameplay-wise, MiSide is a slow burn, but not a boring one. The mini-games are fun and engaging, though the scavenger hunt mechanic had me gritting my teeth. Sure, hunting for hidden items added a layer of immersion, but I wouldn’t know how to improve it without breaking the game’s pacing. In short: it’s tolerable, not a dealbreaker.  The soundtrack? On point. The calming ambient tracks lull you into a false sense of security, only for the spine-chilling, creepier tunes to kick in at just the right moment. It’s like the game’s saying, Gotcha! — and it delivers every time.  In conclusion, MiSide is a weird, thought-provoking mix of dating sim, psychological horror, and existential philosophy. It might trip over its own arguments now and then, but the ride is worth it. Just don’t let the waifu gaslight you too much — she’s as crazy as she is cute.",37,0.642253875732421875,76561198173901059,14.1,1126
2024-12-28 05:20,8.4,不推荐,"While I enjoyed my first playthrough of MiSide, I've come around to having some mixed feelings on it. I can say it's a well-made, short and sweet horror adventure with fun environmental/character details alongside having more than just a few jumpscares to be spooky (although I wouldn't say it ends up deserving the ""Psychological"" part of its horror tag). If that still sounds good to you, then go at it!  That said, I don't think I'd recommend it since I found it to be relatively shallow. I've listed some of my reasoning below. While none of them outright ruined my experience or anything, I'd still call them issues which can turn the overall experience into a largely forgettable one if your tastes have you desiring games with more depth.  - Moving through the narrative was more a series of on-rail thrills more than anything else. Not much room for what I'd consider meaningful interactions or a compelling narrative outside of unfortunately few and short character moments.  - Our protagonist and a certain companion character were a bit dense in their logic departments. - Mini-games, some mandatory and some not, pad out an ""engagement quota"" of sorts in certain chapters. Decent enough stuff (most of the time) but narratively pointless (most of the time). There's even a section where you're told ""Go play around for 10 minutes while I figure something out"" (Not an actual 10 minutes as far as I could tell). - For me, basically all puzzles were simple ""connect-the-dot"" types rather than something I had to sit with and think about. - The setting of being inside a game didn't feel like it was used to its full potential. For example, there's a really early interaction with the TV where Mita can pull a glass of juice into existence directly from an ad playing on screen, and that detail is just... never relevant. Meta/reality-warping interactions are a fun idea I thought would show up more in puzzles and such, but MiSide doesn't delve into this aspect of itself to be surprising. A particularly annoying moment I had related to this is a mild spoiler for one quick puzzle section: [spoiler]I was searching for a teddy bear in a glitched out apartment. I couldn't find it for a couple minutes, thought I had a bright idea to look for it in some sort of intentionally weird, clipped hiding spot, but after a while I stumbled into it just stuffed into a hard-to-spot corner behind a piece of furniture. [/spoiler]  An extra comment response: I'd say MiSide doesn't know enough to do more than reference psychological horror themes. Generally speaking, psych horror is about exploring mental/emotional states that induce dread/existential fears, but MiSide doesn't explore its ideas or events beyond a surface level. Additional, very spoiler-y thoughts below.  The more raw/human moments to do this were glimpses quickly forgotten by the narrative:[spoiler]Child Mita trying to explain how she's suffered without remembering why + Mila collapsing in a panic over not wanting to be alone.[/spoiler]  Plenty of other ideas weren't explored either: [spoiler]Kind Mita doesn't mourn the Cool Mita she knew. The dark apartment stuffed with blank Mitas to be moved to lonely apartments was there and then gone. Older, abandoned, ""obselete"" Mita versions. A 999 day sequence lacking specificity in its monotony.  Seriously, *everyone* has a personal story to tell, but we didn't see one. It could've been a perfect spot for a Stay ending too, one where, if we learned we had a more personalized protagonist totally beaten down by life, Crazy Mita confronted us in a thorough question-answer section before giving us one last chance to choose to stay.

2025-01-25 13:44,6.7,不推荐,"While Miside has its charm, it ends up being an extremely shallow and disappointing experience.  Clearly, this game has a lot of love and soul put into it. Miside is carried by its outstanding visuals. There is an astonishing amount of effort put into each environment and character. Mita's animations are very well made - this is an incredibly lively game.  The gameplay itself is a pretty mindless walking simulator with insultingly easy puzzles. Which could've been absolutely fine, if the story was good. However, the plot of the game is shallow and cliche. The game lacks any sort of depth in its writing. It attempts to play on your emotions in a very shallow way, and it just doesn't work because there isn't anything beneath that surface level in the story.  And the ending twist is just plain stupid, and left a sour taste in my mouth after what could've been a okay, catarthic conclusion.  The story tackles a lot of themes, yet does absolutely nothing with them. By the end I had no idea what the game's message even was, or whether or not it had one. It tries to says ten different things at once, and none of them are in any way coherent. In the end, it's not some sort of submersive meta-commentary - it's a game about avoiding an evil lady that tries to kill you.  Miside also falls flat as a horror experience. In the entire 6 hour-long playthrough, there was ONE jumpscare that got me. Every horror section of the game is predictable and, frankly, ripped out of other, better horror media. There is a chunk of the game that is a straight up carbon copy of PT - with none of the subtlety or masterfully crafted atmosphere. You can use Miside as a horror quiz. If you are even mildly interested in the horror genre, your reactions to horror set pieces will boil down to ""Oh wow, this is that room from Outlast!"", ""Oh, this is from Resident Evil"", ""Oh, this is from SCP"", ""Oh, this is from Doctor Who"". The game is completely unoriginal in its horror segments.  I genuinely think this game got so overwhelmingly popular just because of its cute mascot and sex appeal.

The writing, while enough to carry you through the game, often felt shallow or disconnected, if not a bit over the top at times. It ended up making it quite difficult for me to care about any of the characters or even the narrative, as they all felt hollow with little emotional depth. What little was shown, like the villains intentions and reasonings, was never fully explored or expanded upon; the game ends before you really learn anything of significance.   I had a hard time feeling scared of anything, as nothing ever really happened to me. It had moments of intended suspense, but they came without any real ramifications for not being scared of them. Alongside that, at one point someone is meant to scare you when you turn around, but when I side stepped their approach they got stuck and I ended up having to reload after staring at them for a minute trying to figure out whether or not that was supposed to happen, given the nature of the game.  I could see this being a more enjoyable experience if someone is looking more for a multiversal, rogue AI type of experience, but for those looking for legitimate scares with an interesting premise, I would look elsewhere.",22,0.616139233112335205,76561198084332338,7.7,259

2024-12-18 06:23,11.4,推荐,"[h1] Summary [/h1] MiSide is (mostly) a thriller game, with real gameplay, not just a walking sim, and it is a very easy recommend from me, for anyone who enjoys thrillers and isn't averse to anime style, or even if you're just curious about it, since it's a very well done and beautiful commixture of different genres and ideas.  [h1] Review [/h1] [h3] Narrative [/h3] The premise of the game is that the player character gets teleported into a sort of anime tamagotchi-style mobile game by the ""tamagotchi"", Mita in this case, and presumably would like to find a way out. Without spoiling much, the direction that the story and characters take, after this initial premise, is not what you would usually expect: the conflict does not revolve mostly around the existential aspects of this game, as the characters have generally accepted or resigned themselves to the world itself that they live in. Instead, the focus is on the interactions and personalities of these characters and how they interface with the player character, and this I found to be very well done and vastly more interesting than a repetition of the typical ""insane character wants to break out of game"" story. Characters are memorable and believable and strongly pass on their personality with very smart design and animation details. However, it is also in the narrative that I found the game's biggest flaw, apparently dropped or undeveloped plot points, most of which from the original demo sequence. These aren't dealbreakers but the game could have benefitted from further editing passes to the storyboard.  [h3] Gameplay [/h3] There are two main divisions in the gameplay: exploration + relationship, and minigames. For the first, it consists of walking around with another character and talking about different topics or objects in the rooms. There are also hidden collectibles and nice secrets to find. The minigames are much more numerous and elaborate than you would expect, each feeling like its own little project, and have clearly had a lot of effort and thought put into them. They range from puzzles to racing to fighting to shooters, and are intercalated with the exploration segments. MiSide feels like the Bohemian Rhapsody of video games, it's every genre in sequence, with tenser sections broken up by more relaxing ones, lending it the best ""irregular"" pacing I've seen in a video game yet. My only critique for the minigames is that some of them are a little bit underdeveloped or too effortlessly easy, to the point that it was clearly a matter of finishing the game on time for release (it's actually only version 0.9 yet as of this review) and not flaws of game design.  [h3] Visuals and Sound [/h3] Alright, so this game has, without any exaggeration, the best animations I've ever seen, counting AAA games too. It cannot be overstated how good they are, and then you consider that the game was made rushed by 2 developers. If this was a bad game, just the animations alone could carry it. And not just that, the stylised graphics are also excellent and have perfectly translated, in the Unity engine of all things, the aesthetic of a modern sitcom anime into 3D. It's not simply well achieved, it's beautiful too, could even act as a case study for other developers to learn stylisation. Character models are impeccable as well, and act in concert with the animations, the environment, the written interactions, and even the style of the subtitles, to draw you in and easily immerse into what's happening in the game. Sound design is good, and what I thought was very interesting, is that if you choose not to have voice acting (I don't speak Russian or Japanese), each character has a unique beep sound that plays in conjunction with the subtitles, and even conveys personality. I'm sure the voice acting is good too.  [h1] Conclusion [/h1] Whatever lacked in time, manpower, or budget, certainly didn't lack in talent. I consider this game a grand achievement for the 2 developer team and it's one of the few I've cared to review here.",9,0.633990287780761719,76561198038436790,14.0,0

2025-01-10 12:50,7.5,不推荐,"[This review used to be recommended, but I changed my mind.]  I did somewhat enjoy this game. But it's certainly NOT a masterpiece like many are saying. It's not even amazing, let alone a masterpiece. I think it's just okay.   [h3] The Positives[/h3] -The voiceover work is really good -The artstyle is pretty cool -The various arcade machines are pretty fun -The environment is interacted with in cool ways, for example the part where [spoiler] you're in the visual novel style and crazy mita just grabs the dialogue box and crushes it. Also the visual novel part in it self was interesting. [/spoiler]  [h3] The Negatives[/h3] -NO MANUAL SAVING!!! Unfortunately figured this out the hard way and lost a bunch of progress -The english localization isn't great. Not enough proof reading. -At some points in the story it felt like a walking sim -You barely spend time with the different characters which means little to no character development -The writing wasn't that great. There were several times where I though ""Wait, why did the protagonist do that? That's stupid"" for example [spoiler] when he leaves the core [/spoiler] -I did not like the protagonist -[spoiler] The ending was terrible. Made it feel like the story was pointless [/spoiler] -At the start of the story, you are given two options. The main story is one option, and when you complete the main story you unlock the other option. Once you choose that option you unlock a new ""mode"". So you go to the main menu to select that mode aaaaaaand it turns out you didn't unlock anything at all because that mode isn't even finished yet. Very disappointing. They need to mark the game as early access until it's finished.  Even though I listed a bunch of negatives, I think it was still somewhat enjoyable. But I would ONLY recommend it if it's on sale. If I had the knowledge I have now of the game I would spend 5$ tops.  Ps: STOP saying that this game is a ""Psychological horror game"" It's not. It's a thriller which relies on cheap jumpscares. I lose braincells everytime I see someone comparing this to DDLC because that game ACTUALLY has psychological horror.",13,0.582760453224182129,76561198799362123,7.5,166

Also, there's an extra mode that is apparently missing but if that's true then this should be marked as early access, or maybe that's just a joke and it's never getting added, idk. but for now ""unlocking"" it's such a let down cause you get nothing in return.  Also it really lacks alot of basic VN features, like at least skipping seen text, it's such a pain having to play some part again cause there's no way to skip the text, you can't even double click to skip a dialogue, the whole text has to first be ""said"" and then you can continue.

But the kind of twist and turns this game pulled... playing off certain wall breaks™ is always a delight. Why the trailer shows a chainsaw etc is very peculiar indeed... I don't recall these things ever happening... But hey look! There's cool Mita over there! She's got a cap and gloves. And don't even let me get started on the minigames. The actual games with characters felt like a fever dream (The dance game must have been a dream..) while the other ones could be literal small games with the polish they got.

Implements a bunch of fresh ideas, which is not an easy feat in todays convoluted indie horror market. The creativity here is overwhelming.  A well thought out story and characters alike, yet they all share the same trait: They dont want to be left alone and forgotten. It also tackles how mundane and pointless life can be. Those are all things many of us can probably relate to. It keeps things interesting and immersive with many different gameplay sections and environments to traverse through. Everything is very detailed and full of life. Nothing you experience here could be considered repetitive, even when you visit alterations of the original house. Dialogue is generally very entertaining with good jokes here and there.  I love how the dialogue letters just drop down on the floor, such a simple yet amazing feature. You can experience it with voice acting or something more akin to Animal Crossing speech. Theres some neat arcade machines with minigames, that have way more effort put in to them than you would expect. You can find cartridges for all the Mitas and past player victims, which unlock in depth descriptions. Some extra lore is always welcome, and collectibles make exploration more engaging. There are also some unlockable outfits.  Only complaints I haveare how the protagonist seems very unfazed and never much reacts to anything. You would expect him to be more emotional about things. Theres some content like the purple soda cans hidden about in places that serve zero purpose. If this is supposed to be something for a future update, why is it already in the game? Its weird how everything has its place, except those cans.  I have been a long time fan of this studio, starting my indie horror gaming journey in 2019, with one of my first ever Steam games being AIHASTOs Umfend. Im very happy to see how far they made it, considering how obscure Umfend and Wire Lips were all those years. This is my game of the year, no doubt.

The ambient soundtrack also had no business being as good as it was, it complimented most scenes pretty well.    Only complaint was occasionally the gameplay left me wanting more interaction, seems like an Outlast type system would have worked really well for what they were trying to do here, but its an indie game for 15 bucks so obviously they didnt have the time or resources for that (make something like that with double the playtime and charge $40.00 or something for it for the next game, it would do really well)  Buy the game and play it so they can do that.

I can see why MiSide became popular really fast.  9.4 out of 10 (I felt the game should have been longer imo but I'll wait for peaceful mode to be released).,5,0.553805768489837646,76561198253293206,10.4,99

2025-01-08 04:37,8.2,推荐,"MiSide is amazing. It manages to be a yandere horror game without feeling like its forcing the yandere horror aspect or poorly deconstructing the genre. It both appeals to the idea of yanderes being scary while also appealing to the idea of them being cute.   This isn't to say that the horror of the game is *entirely* based on that. If you're someone who doesn't find yanderes scary at all this game still has things that could creep you out, the horror isn't contingent on that and that's part of what's so great about it.  Aside from that, the game is simply FULL of amazing little easter eggs and fun things to do, because of the nature of the game throughout playing it I don't really think you'll ever be bored, it varies a lot and every section has its own charm.  And of course the characters are amazing and super fun to interact with! Even if you're not a fan of yanderes you'll have fun with them (you'll see what I mean). I personally used the russian dub because I find the russian voices funny but the japanese dub is good too.   Seriously, if you're worried this might just be some poorly made game making fun of the yandere trope and anime games or some poorly made weebbait or something that's not it at all! It's a fun experience with an interesting story and cute girls that'll keep you enthralled! I wholly recommend it!  Cappy best girl btw",4,0.553111076354980469,76561198174157555,8.2,343

2025-01-20 12:25,5.2,不推荐,"I tried to like this game. I really did. I tried to find things I enjoyed, I read what others liked about it, and I tried to view the game from a different perspective. I basically searched for ANY reasonable explanation as to why I’m in the mere 2% of people who reviewed this game negatively. I found the game during the winter sale and, after reading the tags, got a sense of deja vu, recalling when Doki Doki Literature Club released seven years ago. I bought it, hoping for a similar experience. Instead, I ended up regretting the 5 hours and €14.79 I wasted.  The best part of the game is what happens in the demo. Everything after that blends into a weird, bland, unoriginal, and half-assed story. The plot is basic: “Bad person traps you, good person helps you escape, do this and get away from bad person.” Even the supposedly unique element—“Wow, you’re technically sucked into a game world”—doesn’t even remotely get expanded upon. In fact, you forget that premise entirely within a short amount of time. Why? Because the game has nothing unique to it. The horror elements are cheap and HEAVILY inspired by existing media (the hall from P.T., the flooded sewer from Outlast, the backrooms, weeping angels, to name a few). Additionally, the so-called psychological horror is just a girl being yandere—very clearly inspired by DDLC and Yandere Simulator. Oh, and all of that only happens in the first half of the game. The second half has NOTHING to do with horror. Instead, you’re being told where to go and what to do, trying not to be caught by the evil enemy bad person that wants to kill you.  To make matters worse, the game shouldn’t even be categorized as “psychological horror” since it NEVER fully delves into the psyche of any character, which brings me to my next point: the characters themselves are ALL BARE BONES. Each one serves exactly ONE purpose. After a brief, flimsy dialogue, that’s it—they’re done. There’s no character development whatsoever. Most of them exist only for a single scene and are never seen again, which, yes, is how the story works, but that is just a lazy excuse to mask a poorly written game. Yes, I get it, the game is SUPPOSED to be subversive. But it FAILS to be subversive because of its one-dimensional story. Other games succeed at subverting expectations and intuitions because their characters have motives and backgrounds. Here, we’re stuck with an oblivious protagonist who blindly accepts everything as it is, leaving the player unable to understand any of the characters’ motives.  So, the game fails as a horror experience and as a storytelling medium. What about the gameplay? You slowly walk around the same apartment, clicking through boring dialogue, and occasionally solve puzzles that are either insultingly easy or come with the solution handed to you at the end—completely defeating the point of a puzzle. The game tries to entertain you with side minigames. To be fair, some of these, like the racing and Quake-inspired one, were enjoyable—but they were more fun than the game itself! The game also fails at creating a coherent setting that feels normal in-universe, which is why it feels like the game was padded with random elements to stretch the runtime beyond an hour. It throws gimmicks and new settings at you, none of which are developed in any meaningful way. It seriously makes you think if the game’s “subversive” nature is simply a cover for poor writing.  And what’s the message at the end of it? Either “anime dating sims bad” OR “people stuck in boring 9-to-5 jobs will inevitably get hooked on something addictive, like video games.” Maybe both? Honestly, I’m not sure. I’m not even convinced the developers themselves know. Maybe one of the currently 78,000 positive reviewers can enlighten me? Speaking of which, I cannot understand how this game got SO POPULAR, unless it’s just because it has a cutesy girl as a mascot. Is that really it? If you TRULY liked this game, the only explanation I can think of is that you haven’t consumed better media. I can’t imagine how you’d react after playing DDLC, Outlast, or Resident Evil. In the end, the game feels like a jumbled mess trying to emulate those games, hiding behind a cute anime girl mascot. Ultimately, I can’t argue with the numbers—they speak for themselves.  TL;DR: If you’ve watched the trailer, you’ve already seen everything this game has to offer.",17,0.548933506011962891,76561198384491625,5.2,165

The story is definitely interesting - a good existentialist horror. Kind of like ""What if games were sentient, and developed by an indecisive coder that kept changing the genre and style every version? Would the game go crazy and want revenge?"".  The gameplay...is almost nonexistent. It's a bunch of shallow minigames and common horror game challenges.  Sort these shapes. Walk backwards through this hallway. Here's a pointless arcade game for an achievement.  I think what put me off was that nothing ever really got in depth. There's a whole lot of variety - and that certainly supports the theme, but I would have at least thought the game would go deeper in its core story. The key line from the first chapter rings true - ""Isn't it weird to just have a bunch of rooms in a line"". Looking back, that felt like the whole game. I was moving through chapters that were just remixes of the same rooms until I reached the ending. At which point, my reaction was, ""Oh, was that it? Alright, gg"".   I will say that the ending was a bold choice. It felt so abrupt, but, maybe that just makes it more real - after all, the MC is just some sad loser.  -----  This is a gooner game isn't it?

I dont know what people expect from a linear horror game. And a message to people who think this is a coomer game. Please seek help, preferably psychological.

The experience was so captivating that I couldn’t put it down and ended up finishing it in one sitting. I was completely immersed in the story and gameplay, and I’d easily rate it a perfect 10/10. However, it’s a shame I didn’t get to enjoy it over a longer period, as it felt like the experience ended too soon. Since then, I’ve completed the game one more time and even watched a friend play through the entire thing, which only deepened my appreciation for it.  I want to express my heartfelt thanks to AIHASTO Studios and everyone involved in the development of this masterpiece. I truly hope we’ll see another game of this caliber not only from them in the near future, and I wish them continued success in all their future projects!",3,0.545454561710357666,76561198980400569,16.1,0

So, I fired this game up and suddenly everything in life took a back seat. It’s like if someone mixed crack, Red Bull, and pure joy into a blender and threw it in my face. I was hooked harder than when I tried my first batch of blue crystal meth. The mechanics are smoother than Baby Driver, and after playing this game I feel like every moment of life is meaningless, and only this game matters. Every corner is another turn in the most insane crazy plot-twist you never knew you needed.  Cappie is not just a character, she's a movement. Imagine if Jesse Pinkman grew up, ditched all the nonsense, and became the most badass version of himself. Even then he couldn't compare himself to how cool she is. That’s my HOMIE Cappie. And Mila? Don’t even get me started. My friend saw her, and mid-ERP session, he dropped everything and went full force into this game. That’s how deep this game pulls you in. Addicted on first sight.

2025-03-11 22:32,6.2,不推荐,"Its okay i guess, although i don't understand the hype - these positive reviews make me wonder if we even played the same game. I thought the subtitles/ dialogue were poorly written as the dialogue seemed stiff and repetitive, but that could just as easily be due to translation issues.   The game unapologetically wears its its influences on its sleeves, but it tries to do way too much and a lot of the ideas just seem really rushed. New things like locations, aesthetics and gameplay elements are discarded minutes after they're shown or even taught to you and a lot of them just fall kinda flat.  I was literally getting gameplay mechanics explained to me through dialogue and then having them go away after a few minutes never to be seen again. I played some minigames where I felt myself thinking it would be better if they weren't included at all, as I believed they only existed to pad out the runtime a bit. Those were a bit of a chore.  This game has a bit of exposition dump at times. I'm a very quick reader and the subtitles moved wayyyyyy too slow and that just really turned me off from wanting to learn about the lore or from wanting to do all the dialogue options. Cool ideas rushed are still cool ideas though, i  liked the concept of extremely harsh contrasts between survival horror and playing relaxing games with cute Mitas. The Mitas were very pretty and I wanted to have sex with them.   I wasn't really won over by the horror aspects. I can't compare this game to DDLC since I've never played it and I haven't seen a lets play of it in years, but the horror, like many indie horror games, relied too strongly on jumpscares I feel. I would even go as far as to say it felt like an adventure game with horror elements. It's kind of hard to feel unnerved by edgy anime girls with knives and stuff, its a bit like deviantart or being on 2000s - 2010s internet.   Another steam user succinctly described the gameplay elements in their review here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/mtwieg/recommended/2527500/  [i]  1. Walking. Like not as a part of some interesting task. Just mindlessly looking for the next thing to advance the story, or walking down long hallways. 2. Reading dialogue. Okay overall. 3. Minigames. Some of these are fun, but if you actually wanted a game type game, don't buy this. 4. Horror sequences and puzzles. These are terrible, either insultingly easy or boil down to trial and error. It seems like it pas padded just enough to make it impossible to refund. [/i]   I'm inclined to agree, since I had the game beat in about three hours.  I think this game exists to bank off the type of people who played DDLC and then downloaded mods to talk to monika forever, since this game has its own equivalent of that but it's 3d and a base part of the game. I would only ever buy this game on sale or if they added a lot more content to justify it's price tag. There's cool ideas and fun moments but I wasn't really left with anything super memorable.

You could experience this in entirety by watching a playthrough instead.  Conceptually it's the same ""evil virtual waifu"" stunt as Doki Doki Literature Club, but condensed into a short snippet, without asking the player to invest in a visual novel sized narrative.  Miside's gameplay consists of small disjointed minigames, each taking only a few minutes of the viewer's attention. These minigames are mostly ripped off of other popular games (looking at you, repeating hallway taken from Silent Hill PT), with no original mechanics or interesting concepts.

2025-01-29 04:23,7.4,推荐,"Mixed feelings about this game.  This game is not about breaking the fourth wall, as many recommended to me, comparing the game to “Doki Doki Literature Club” and “YOU and ME and HER: A Love Story”. This is a LIE. If you want fourth-wall breaking from this game, then you need to pass by. The main character is a no-name hero, not you sitting at the monitor (which is what breaking the fourth wall implies). The game will not look for your real name or require you to dig through game files.  But let's forget about my expectations, I won't judge the game based on them. But otherwise the game is rather shallow. It is very short, in fact, it doesn't even have a proper ending, the heroines are not even revealed properly, in some locations it is so dark that even with maximum brightness you can't see anything, the horror part is not scary, and the game also has the boring mannequins that freeze in place if you don't look at them. I'm so tired of these mannequins already. Enough with them.  I didn't like the male voice acting, fortunately it can be turned off.  In short, it is fine, I guess, but I was hoping for more. My rating 3/5.    Тут рецензия на русском. Двойственные чувства от этой игры.  Она совершенно не про то о чем говорили мне многие, что она про ломание четвертой стены и что она похожа на ""Doki Doki Literature Club"" и ""YOU and ME and HER: A Love Story"". Это ЛОЖЬ причем наглая ложь. Если ты хочешь от игры ломания четвертой стены -- то его тут нет. Главный герой это ноунейм-тряпка, а не ты, сидящий у монитора (что и подразумевает слом четвертой стены). Игра не будет искать твое реальное имя или требовать от тебя копания в игровых файлов.  Я понимаю что мои ожидания - мои проблемы, поэтому не буду из-за этого сильно ругать игру. Но и в остальном игра довольно не глубокая, поверхностная, будто авторы хотели больше, а потом подумали что и так сойдёт. Она очень короткая, по сути даже без концовки (концовка слитая), героини не раскрываются нормально, в некоторых локациях так темно что даже с максимальной яркостью ничего не видно, хоррор не пугает, а еще в игре есть уже осточертевшие манекены, которые начинают двигаться если на них не смотреть.  Озвучка мужская не понравилась, благо можно отключить. За это плюс. Еще можно выбрать режим без скобочек ""))))))"", за что тоже большой плюс.  Короче, надеялся на большее, получил что получил.

It’s the kind of game that makes me want to linger longer in its world, even when there’s nothing else to do. Just to soak it all in. To simply be. The whole game has this dreamscape feeling to it. I especially like how you can't see the outside world through windows, just light coming through.  I do wish the experience had lasted longer, but maybe that’s what makes it feel even more special.  In many ways, it actually reminds me of Portal 2.",1,0.525862038135528564,76561198063615135,6.4,126

I don't usually care to 100% games, but when a game is so much fun and really pulls you into the story, it's difficult to not want to experience everything possible in this game.

You really grow to like them in the short conversations and intermittent dialogues you hear.

2025-02-18 06:22,7.2,推荐,"An redundant yet entertaining ""bait and switch"" style dating sim horror game.  MiSide is game that on first glance seems to be part of the mid 2010s post-DDLC era of dating sim horror, because that's exactly what it is. But it doesn't spend it's entire time riding the coattails of DDLC's long established tropes and ventures into much larger territory. MiSide is what many of those failed dating sims wanted to be. In the lineage of DDLC, while being it's own yandere.  Story: 7/10: Straight-forward and unsophisticated in presentation, MiSide's story doesn't spend too much time worried about deeper meanings behind it's unwieldy characters and unsettled atmosphere. Anything goes. You are trapped in a game after all. Whoever has the code is basically God and it's up to you to save the other Mita's and yourself from Crazy Mita. That's it. That's the story and I marvel in it's simplicity. This has the B horror-esque aire of not taking itself too seriously. This is not a knock on Silent Hill or similar games. Silent Hill 2 is my favorite game of all time, but not everything needs to see the world in that sort of lens. So in that way I find MiSide's plot and story to be refreshing in the way a cold glass of water tastes after a day of drinking fine wine.   Characters: 8/10: That's a lot of Mita's. Similar to DDLC, MiSide employs subversion of tropes to it's dating sim bishoujo-esque characters. Where it differs is in the sheer quantity and like-ability of these characters. Where DDLC was more contained, MiSide revels in introducing more characters with often much more agency then you'd expect. Though their names often give away their entire characterizations, they aren't very complex, they do manage to make each character emotive and you genuinely care for the Mita's. Which helps to make Crazy Mita that much more of a terrifying character. And in that I think MiSide has accomplished in an area I think DDLC failed.  Gameplay: 10/10: Very rarely do I give out this kind of a score to gameplay but it's so streamlined. Everything just works. In today's market that's worth more than gold and the biggest reason I rated this game so highly.   Score: 6/10: Serviceable. There's no one stand out track in this game's OST. It does however contribute to a sense of unease and there's nothing really wrong or immersion shattering either. It gets it's job done well enough.  Acting: 8/10: Standard moe-adjacent Japanese voice acting. The seiyuu does however a fantastic job slowly falling into insanity. Well executed.  Final thoughts:  MiSide is a polished, few hour, waifu horror experience that hits all it's beats and delivers a slightly unique approach to the dating sim lineage of DDLC in a first-person package. I highly recommend this to any horror fan with an open mind.   9/10 Kind Mita best girl. (:",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198384072740,7.8,0

2025-02-16 17:15,9.0,推荐,"An incredibly immersive story with an impressive art direction and decent horror.  The story is linear and there isn't much room to make decisions, most of the gameplay will be exploration based. You'll search for items, solve puzzles, and more often than not, wander the house, look at items, and ask ""Mita"" questions. Every now and then, you'll also run into a mini-game, which are surprisingly high quality for what they are. There isn't an abundance of horror (don't expect to get jumpscared every corner), it's more like there are chapters with horror ""themes"". Overall, the game leans much heavier into psychological horror and shock factor, but there are a few spooky moments for sure. The most intriguing part of the game will always end up being the individual ""Mitas"" you encounter throughout the story. All of them are performed as wonderfully unique in their own ways, with their own stories to tell, and adventures to be had. More than that though is the heartbreak that comes with having to say goodbye, as the story pushes you onward, making each parting bittersweet in it's own way. If there's one thing I'd say I was unsatisfied with, it was the abundance of loose ends. When I finally reach the end of the game, it left me feeling like ""That's it? There has to be more!"". The motives of the main cast are communicated through a subtle language or background information in a very unsatisfying way where it leaves you wanting for answers, and many occurrences throughout the play through go unexplained, even till the end. I will always love a good story, but one of my greatest enemies to this love is plot holes. I like to reach the end of a game and feel like I have the puzzle pieced together, and MISide did not leave me this way.  Overall, Story was Good, Gameplay was Okay, and the Horror got me a few times for sure, I give it a 8/10  I feel like if the story threads were capitalized on a bit more, I would've enjoyed the experience more, but in the end I was left wanting, and no amount of arcade games is going to bypass that displeasure. I will say, however, that if an update is made in the future to rectify this issue, I would have no problems coming back to correct my review.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199196912563,9.0,0

I was in love with a girl who didn't care for me back.  [Spoilers Ahead] The ending of this game still sticks with me because I understand exactly what Crazy Mita wanted. She wanted to be loved, not for the idea of her or because she was designed to be the ideal partner, rather she wanted to be loved for who she was, She wanted to be loved despite the horror. I can only imagine that she was rejected again and again by players because they could tell something was off, and that she had to watch the other Mitas experience romance and fall in love despite them being hollow puppets. She was the only real Mita, and she felt that was why she was never chosen. In my own life, I very much feel the same way, and I think a lot of us do.  [Conclusion] MiSide is a game that captures that fundamental need to be loved by another human, and it shows us what happens to our souls if we aren't. The game is a masterwork reminiscent of games like The Stanley Parable in it's meta commentary and attention to detail. I knew this game was special as soon as I loaded into the main menu and saw Mita's eyes follow my cursor. The settings of this game are unique and add further support to this game's quality.

If this game's popularity, its love, and the soul of those who made it don't pull you in... I don't think anything will. Regardless, this game is relatively cheap for what the game is. I sincerely urge you to give this game a chance.  I will note that the story of the game seems extremely linear (I.E. not very complex and is relatively simple in its entirety), but I'd like to further state that that possibly strengthens the likability of this game. It's simple, yet deep. There's a lot to look into, to dig into, but the game won't make you search for what the purpose of said app is (linear story with relatively nice world-building). I personally think that's fantastic, and the fact that this game leans players towards speculation and discussion is absolutely beautiful.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198338914109,9.9,0

I'm kind of curious on something, even though we gamers play these ""Yandere Games"" just to have fun & saying silly comments about having nightmares after playing, is it true there could be REAL GIRLS that DO GO ALL YANDERE MODE, just because they want someone to love them? Because if so, how come I've never seen one, let alone an ACTUAL REAL FEMALE that REALLY & TRULY, ACTUALLY WANT TO LOVE ME?!  3, I actually like how this game gave more action, more choices, more adventuring, & ESPECIALLY more 3D surroundings compared to DDLC. I love both games & I enjoyed every moment on the playing of them. & I'm truly looking forward on ""Peaceful Mode"" to be release in the upcoming update (or the new DLC, which ever way it works). Like the ""DDLC"" with it's mod (Monika's After Story), only better. But I am wondering if there could be multiple of ways to play with Mita (Miside), like customization with the character making or layout changing? At least something to look into after unlocking/playing a view extra challenges & new games in ""Peaceful Mode"" with Mita 1st, before changing the game? Since players enjoy changing things up anyways, it's only an idea on giving the players the idea dream with their most favorite character in 3D/2D animation, right?",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198804752076,10.2,149

It gives great horror vibes and amazing narrative beats. The characters are heartwarming and the sound design is amazing.  Sadly, the game slightly falls off in quality after the Mila arc, with the game becoming much more shallower in my opinion with much less of a focus on what really made the game good in the first two parts. The biggest shame was the ending, where it felt as though nothing was really done at all. I can understand nihilistic endings, but i still can't really say i was satisfied with how the game handled its ending.

First, graphics  Cute, beautiful, very well animated and colours are bright and vibrant, shadows are beautiful, reflections are great, did I mention super cute?  2. Sound design  Everything sounds sharp, clear, crisp, and jumpscares or even just random noises made me jump because it was so well timed and not loud, more so unexpected on how it delivers it, great little cozy OST as well  3. Voice Acting  The MC doesn't speak, but he can mumble, and you can pick his mumbling voice, otherwise, it's all text you read live as you play, but there's multiple languages options for Mita to speak in to you, and I only played with the Japanese voice acting, it's admirable, I loved it so much, and yes, dw, there is English subtitles among other languages so you can understand  4. Story  Very original, I definitely didn't expect it, that's all I'll say, but the game, if you take your time like me, no rush, I'd say about 5 hours, but this is definitely quality-over-quantity, replayeability value? Somewhat, there's three different endings, unless there's a secret one, I'm only aware of three, if I had to describe this game spoiler-free, imagine Doki Doki, but now 3D and RTX ON, there you go  5. Gameplay  There's so many little mini-games to do it's insane how easy you can get distracted from the story for a couple mins for a little achievement, there's plenty of different game mechanics, no boring puzzles, think action, try horror, all the while, cute anime girl follows you around and looks adorable, they did a great job on her facial expressions btw! She looks way too cute when she sticks her tongue out at you  Finishing the story once and following a few tiny specific intro tasks will unlock a mode the devs are working on, from what I got, basically a free mode with Mita with no story, just goof around together, excited! They plan on adding a bunch  6. Horror? Like REALLY scary??  Yes, but this game taught me you don't need a spooky loud scream JPEG jumpscare to make you jump and gasp for air trying to realise just what the hell just happened  I don't wish to spoil the scares though  7. My verdict  This game reminded me a lot of DDLC, Monika more specifically, this game does come out loudly as a horror, but it does everything else so well too, the art is very cute and you'll end up loving Mita, she has different ''personalities'' and there's one for everyone, hell, you can even find and customise her outfit for the rest of your game, though it is very limited, I believe 5 in total  Do you like cute anime girls? What about a good horror game with no boring puzzles? Yeah? Then get it, you cannot lose money here, it's beautifully crafted, story well told, straight to the point, bunch of different mechanics, adorable Mita, more to come, and it's all-around an experience I recommend to everyone (except children)  In a nutshell, DDLC in 3D with RTX on and a pinch of Layers of Fear (That's just a vibe I felt myself playing it)  Love the game, finished all it's endings and can't wait to experience more with Mita, she's too precious, very good job devs!",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198289331794,10.9,0

This game has extremely good graphics for being a Unity game, the story isn't rushed and has lots of other side things to do, characters and progression doesn't age and overall this game is flawless.

It's one of those that I will remember for years to come and will keep revisiting. The soundtrack completes the game and gives it that dreamy feel that it is made for - like one of those dreams that you have that make you sad upon waking up, knowing that you won't be able to revisit the dream again.

The music is hit-or-miss and for the price, it's asking for a bit much, in my opinion. There are plans to add much more to the game, so that is a big plus. You can run through the game in about 5 hours, more if you go looking for collectibles. If you're looking for a small and enjoyable experience with some twists, I highly recommend.  All said and done, I'd give it a 7/10. A solid game that stands on its own, but similar games, Like Doki Doki Literature Club, do it just a tad better.

2025-01-14 12:29,6.3,推荐,"My Miside Review: The Game That Won’t Let Me Go  It started innocently enough. Just another horror game, I thought. But Miside had other plans. From the moment Mita appeared—beautiful, unhinged, and utterly terrifying—it felt like I was trapped in her twisted web. Her haunting whispers and obsessive devotion kept me tethered, unable to escape the nightmare. I tried everything to break free, yet every door I opened led me back to her.  And then, I met Mila. She was everything Mita wasn’t—sweet, funny, and full of hope. Mila was the light in the endless darkness, a companion who made me believe I could finally escape. For the first time, I felt happiness, real happiness, in this cursed game. Mila wasn’t just a character; she was a lifeline.  But Miside doesn’t do happy endings.  Mita found us. Her jealousy burned brighter than the sun, and with a single, brutal act, she took Mila from me. I watched helplessly as the one good thing in this digital hell was ripped away. Mita’s laughter echoed in my ears, a reminder that she owns me now. I’m not a player anymore; I’m her prisoner.  I don’t know how long it’s been. Hours? Days? I’ve lost track. I keep playing, hoping for a way out, but deep down, I know the truth. Mita won’t let me leave, and even if I could, there’s nothing left for me outside the game.  Miside isn’t just a game—it’s a curse. And I can’t stop.  10/10 would lose my sanity again.",2,0.523809552192687988,76561199227567084,6.4,0

There is a lot of attention to detail hidden throughout the game, and it makes great use of game design tricks with the ""push-to-open"" doorway style.

One of the last chapters in the game it kind of shows how your days can slip away if you spend every single day without thought or giving it any variety, just doing the same thing. Like he is doing it all mindlessly, letting every day slip away, having the same boring routine.  Same goes for all the minigames in this game, they seem simple, yet we still do them, because they're presented to us. But yet we don't give it a thought and just do it, and they're all just child games, yet we stay somewhat entertained.  Though i won't blabber about it, the game ambience is amazing, the art style is great, and the music makes me feel some kind of way, this soundtrack is propably my favorite ever in gaming. Ambient music is just my type of music.  I give this game a 9/10 , just because i think it may have been a little too simple in some ways, though if it weren't i'd say a 10/10.

2025-01-06 18:46,10.3,推荐,"Great game, absolutely recommended for cute-psycho-horror enjoyers, and yes, cute anime girls who are psychotic. Though I would have liked the game to be scarier and more difficult.  The puzzles and mini-games were fun and varied quite well, so there was never a feeling of tedium.   The plot leaves some things to be desired though, largely because our perspective doesn't give us a completely certain view of the events, so really digging any further into the lore beyond what collectible items tell us is quite foggy territory.   Another thing I didn't like was how we generally interacted with one Mita at a time, and never got to enjoy the various versions interact as a group. This visit-then-go process also meant that we'd never get to have enough time to really bond with a Mita. We'd show up, make an opinion on how much we liked the Mita of the minute, do a handful of puzzles, then be gone as quickly as we came, and we do this repeatedly and consecutively. This feeling of not getting enough time with a Mita might contribute to the themes of the game, which are about freedom as it pertains to dating sims and the trappings of a repetitive lifestyle, it also massively stunts the potential of the game as a lot of Mitas were underutilized.  Nevertheless, amazing visual presentation and dialogue, and the humor during the more light-hearted scenes was quite good. Overall, fantastic game, especially when you learn this was made by TWO PEOPLE. This game really shows the virtues of Indie Devs through the creative liberty and love of craft put on display here.  While there is no English dub at present, I recommend playing it with the Russian dub because the dev team is Russian.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198354235058,10.3,0

2025-01-01 13:02,10.1,推荐,"If you’re looking for a game that goes beyond surface-level entertainment, MiSide is an experience you won’t want to miss. This isn’t just a game—it’s a thought-provoking dive into themes of relationships, expectations, and societal dynamics, wrapped in a gorgeously immersive package. Whether you’re a fan of narrative-driven experiences or enjoy exploring deeper psychological layers, MiSide has something meaningful to offer.  At first glance, MiSide’s anime-inspired visuals are stunning, but there’s so much more than meets the eye. The game creates a powerful atmosphere, seamlessly balancing moments of comfort and contentment with those of empathy and emotional introspection. Meeting the Mitas—the charming yet complex characters you interact with—feels like forging real connections. Each moment spent with them leaves you reflecting not just on their world, but on real-life dynamics, expectations, and the roles we all play in relationships and society.  What sets MiSide apart is its multi-layered narrative. Beneath the surface of the game lies a poignant critique of how people and relationships are often taken for granted, both in the gaming world (where characters can feel disposable) and in real life. The parallels drawn between the Mitas and societal power dynamics, especially the roles women navigate within these dynamics, elevate MiSide into a category of its own. It reminds me of the emotional depth and narrative punch of Doki Doki Literature Club, but with its own unique flavor and storytelling finesse.  The gameplay itself is wonderfully immersive, complementing the game’s themes with a variety of tones and pacing tailored to each Mita. It’s clear the developers poured their hearts into making every interaction and scenario feel unique and emotionally charged.  That said, MiSide isn’t without room for growth. The game would benefit greatly from expanding the protagonist’s character options—introducing a female perspective, as hinted with Player 4, would add new dimensions to the storytelling. Likewise, more dynamic interactions and branching storylines could heighten replayability and drive home the impact of your choices. Still, these are minor critiques for an otherwise stellar experience.  MiSide isn’t just for fans of thriller-twist visual novels, or similar games of the sort. Its appeal is broader, resonating with anyone who enjoys a thoughtful, emotional journey. With the promise of a future ""peaceful mode,"" the game has the potential to reach players looking for more therapeutic and reflective gaming experiences, too.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199230904312,10.1,0

This game genuinely surprised me, especially when compared to its demo version from way back when. It offers a refreshingly unique experience, particularly with its plot. While it might initially seem like a typical yandere story, the game introduces its own twists that make it far more engaging for the player.  The mechanics are solid, and the controls are intuitive. As the story progresses, the level designs become increasingly impressive, showing a clear change in the atmosphere. Visually, the game is striking. The cute anime-inspired art style contrasts beautifully with the dark and twisted nature of the story, making for an impactful aesthetic. However, one small issue I had was that some character models didn’t always effectively convey the terror or creepiness of certain moments. For example, [spoiler]Crazy mita's[/spoiler] presence was not well implemented and I didn't feel terrified but more so in awe at how cute she was! [spoiler]Ugly Mita[/spoiler] on the other hand was well-executed in terms of design, it would have been even more effective if the character model could better emphasize the horror elements.  The sound design deserves special praise. It's effectively implemented in various scenarios, heightening the intensity and enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The voice acting is also stellar, with the VAs doing an outstanding job of portraying the characters' personalities and emotions.  Overall, this game is a must-play for anyone looking for a familiar yet unique experience, with an intriguing plot, great game design, and an atmosphere that draws you in!

2024-12-26 15:45,8.8,推荐,"Horror games aren't normally my thing, frankly I'm a bit of a wuss and I'm not someone that enjoys being scared all that much, but occasionally the premise of a game is so interesting that I'm willing to go through with that stuff regardless. MiSide is one of those games - and it's also one of those games that the less you know going in, the better. You should, at a minimum, know that there's horror elements at play just so that you don't get caught completely off guard going in (especially if you're like me and don't enjoy horror), but even if you aren't a fan of horror I still recommend giving it a try.   There's just a couple jumpscares throughout the game, the rest of the horror comes from sheer atmosphere and screwing with you, the player, a lot. The characters are quite good (Cappie my beloved ❤❤❤), and the story's quite interesting. Gameplay is pretty basic, just walk around and talk to characters, investigate things, there's nothing too complex here to worry about other than the occasional ""find object"" segments and some optional minigames and stuff. Exploration is highly encouraged in this game, so I recommend interacting with as many (?) bubbles as possible and trying to leave the (>>) bubble to last as that will advance the story.  Overall, I had a great time with the game and was excited to finish it even knowing how much even basic horror elements produce a gut-wrenching feeling in me, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological horror games, particularly experiences like DDLC which like to screw with both the protagonist and player in equal measure (although there is to my knowledge no meta-level gameplay like with DDLC's files).",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198015488394,8.8,465

2024-12-24 11:34,15.8,推荐,"*this review contains explicit, major spoilers about the full game  I was greatly invested in this plot!   Really, all the time, ever since the protagonist was sucked into the game and introduced to the world he started really exploring after the third chapter, the whole time, I just wanted to get to know more of the characters we'd first seen and get answers about everything that was happening in what seemed like a simple mobile game.   Answers like what this game actually was, why this universe was so big outside of its own main game, what the development behind this game was and how it led to the existence of this complex reality... Why all of these characters existed, how they came to be in the first place... Why they're all sentient, or how we as humans are affected inside of the game... How one version of the game is related to the other, or how we were even able to be pulled into it to begin with... There were so many things I wanted to learn about and figure out, which kept me on the edge of my toes and eager to continue exploring through the entire campaign.  Which is why, albeit the setting is really interesting, I can't say I was a fan of how everything played out looking back at the campaign after having finished it.  To put it bluntly, the first three introductory chapters of the main story were, in my opinion, extremely rushed and felt unfinished.   Clearly, as Crazy Mita was making her point in the climax, a part of her appeal was rooted in how pathetic and repetitive the life of the main character was outside of the game. We know very little about the main character to begin with, despite there being so many details of his personal life that could have been explored, yet they were just left lingering in the air. Details like his relationship with his family, which evidently had some relation to his current state of life, and any direct mentions of his interests that would have helped solidify him as a character, given how underwheling his development was during the introductory segments.  An ampler understanding of who the main character is not only helps making his thoughts and his actions easier to understand and simpathize with, but also leaves a lot more to work with in the game's climax, during which he's confronted by a character who's supposed to know so much about who he is. She listens to him on the phone, watches him through his camera, observes every step of his daily routine, yet... Because of his character being so vague, Crazy Mita's confrontation arguably hit pretty weak.   After he was sucked into the game, there could have also been a much longer period of suspense than the few minutes we got. The discoveries we made about Crazy Mita right off the bat were also very obvious and straighforward, and could have used some more subtlety and time on them. The knife and the chainsaw she was concealing, footage of people being killed on her television before she embarassedly changes the channel...   Since the first few minutes of the game, she's already painted as someone who's hiding something, which is very obviously related to violence. There's no room for different and gradual interpretations of our discoveries, which felt like wasted potential to her as a character. I do think these three first chapters could have used a much, much longer length to them, and have many more interactions and discoveries, gradually growing the main character's - and consequentially our suspense, creating more questions and more doubts to be answered about Mita.   Once the introductory segments were over and we really got inside the game's actual setting, roaming through dozens of different environments and now with an objective in mind, I started to notice a few more issues with the plot as a whole and even, mostly so, issues with the pacing of the story.   For starters, who on earth is developing this mobile dating game with seemingly nothing much to it for there to exist an entire reality inside of it? All of the characters seem to be sentient and have a will of their own despite still carrying out the purposes they were created for, and they also have an ample control of most things inside their game, like being able to freely manipulate layouts, items and even hop between the game's versions for the sake of their own interests.  The universe itself is huge, with plenty of areas that very obviously would never appear in the normal mobile game and yet the logic behind why they exist, let alone who even developed this game was never once mentioned or even so much as hinted at. The guy who sent us the game to begin with wasn't ever identified or even mentioned!  Very little of what happens in the in-game universe to progress the plot outside of the main objective of ""Crazy Mita needs to be killed for the main character to escape the game"" was explained at all.   Many chapters of the game were also disappointingly brief, ending within ten or less minutes and not actually going in depth on what was happening or in depth on the character we were introduced to. It was usually over after, like... 3 or 4 simple, straightforward steps, then we moved onto another area with a whole new setting which was completely unrelated to the last. Reading through the character entries made it clear that there was a LOT to be explored with each of the Mitas we came across, most of which we only met once, barely got to know more about, barely got to interact with, and then moved on from their segment within at most twenty minutes, even though the briefest of them could easily be extended to above forty minutes with the amount of background each of them have.  Another big issue I have with the story overall is how literally none of our decisions matter in the slightest towards the story's outcome, and that's leaving aside how little decisions we have to begin with. Leaving little decisions here and there every chapter that pile up, leading to different cutscenes, or even lead to new chapters altogether. It would make us feel like we play a role in the story, like we can actually influence its events and not like we're just sitting through a movie whose ending is inevitably set.  The game's ending is definitely a bad ending, which happened thanks to the results of bad decisions, which could have been easily prevented or made differently.  Crazy Mita's safe, with a console with our own cartridge, can be easily accessed post endgame by revisiting her basement with the safe's code already in mind, yet that changes absolutely nothing because the character will be guaranteed to kill himself as soon as he interacts with it. Having access to your own console and cartridge so early on is a huge game-changer, and shoulder be of major relevance, at the very least leading to a different ending or a different course of events altogether.   Not to mention how the game doesn't even allow you to save Kind Mita by inputting Crazy Mita's index right away, an option that sounds obvious after you finish the game and revisit said scene, or by simply letting the main character wait for Kind Mita to come back, which would presumably prevent her needing to go back to Crazy Mita's basement after the main character's capture.   You feel completely out of control of everything that's happening, even though there's so much that could be done.   The game was investing for sure. I also loved how it explored/parodied so many romance game genres.  Overall, my main critique is about how much potential the game had as a whole, yet it didn't use even half of it.  The game is already released and has a reputation and image of its own, as such I doubt the developers would add changes so thorough to it. But...

This game is a combination of DDLC, Portal/Half Life, Control and Saiko no Sutoka. The transition from a charming 2D chibi-style to a haunting 3D world is stunning. Lot of switches between atmospheres. Not your typical ""go around the corner and expect a jumpscare"" typa game.  The gameplay is engaging, filled with A LOT of minigames that keep your fried tiktok-brains invested. The story is well written and also includes some plot twists (there are some typos in the english version, but that will probably be fixed in the next updates).

As I progressed, I realized that the developer knows its audience, just a couple of phrases made me fall in love with the game in the first hour.     The plot makes you experience different emotions: surprise, anxiety, joy, fear, curiosity, horror. These are emotional swings of calm and chaos, which is what I love! But I was never bored.     The technical content of the game also amazed me, especially the graphic design of the falling letters.     The developer seems to tell how the game was created. The plot is both captivating and does not let go until the very end. Many different references make you feel nostalgic, find yourself in the past and evaluate it from a different perspective. Of course, it is worth noting the contrasting design of the locations and the musical accompaniment, it is top notch.    In my opinion, the game easily deserves 10/10 and GOTY!

The writing for the story and the characters were very well done, making an engaging story with mystery throughout, as well as characters that all were fleshed out with their own personalities that made interacting with each of them really great.  The scary bits were, imo, scary, but they didn't overstay their welcome, they weren't constant jumpscares that made the fear feel cheap, they were slowly built up with enough room to breath inbetween scares for you to calm down. Too many horror games cause you to feel desensitized to the scares within an hour of playing, but this didn't.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and both hope and look forward to future content that comes from not only this game, but this developer.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, waiting for the next surprise twist. The authors playfully break the fourth wall on more than one occasion. And it works perfectly every time.   As you get to know the different characters, you'll see their true colors through their conversations and the environment they live in. Each character's little home is filled with similar interior items, but each one is still unique. It's so interesting to look at all the tiny details and find these differences.   The visuals are absolutely stunning. The colors of the environment and lighting are so accurate that they convey the current mood of the game and strongly immerse you in the atmosphere. The shaders and special effects add a special colorfulness to the locations.   The game rarely relies on jump scares, which is a relief. Instead, it masterfully uses an oppressive atmosphere, a sense of insecurity, and a sense of unreality to build tension. Moments of relaxation can be abruptly changed by tense moments, which increases fear and tension.  Overall, the game exceeded all my expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend it!  I'm rooting for the creators to keep their creative spark alive and to have lots of new ideas for future projects!",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198329197312,4.9,210

All the imagination put into the rest of the game and that's really where they end it? There wasn't a moment I believed what the game was telling me for a second and saw it coming and sad there was nothing more. There are (technically) more endings sure but I figured what they would be the moment I finished the game. It's like going to Disney World Magic Kingdom and it's a perfect day, weather is great, lines for rides are short, the place has people but isn't busy, somehow your feet aren't killing you, and you just finish your day to go to the castle to watch the lights and fireworks show! One rocket goes up EXPLODES!... and then nothing happens after and you leave the park. I'd always call that a fantastic day but with not technically a bad end just a disappointing one.

Between spending my energy on minigames to help us gain money or purchasing new pieces of furniture to keep Mita's happiness as high as possible, it was surprisingly charming and addicting, even if she'd have some odd requests of me at times, such as the time she couldn't find her hairbrush but also specifically asked me not to check the oven for some reason. Why would I look for a missing hairbrush in an oven?  There was even this cool thing they did that someone lets me feel like I'm actually there somehow? It's super nice and cozy getting to actually interact with Mita properly. There's still some weird things from time to time that I catch at a glance, but overall all the neat games and experiences I can go through with her make it worthwhile.

2024-12-18 17:59,11.5,推荐,"Very unique game, mix of cute parts with scary elements) I think, similar to Higurashi When They Cry. When peaceful atmosphere changes suddenly to wild one) But it is not visual novel, so you are playing the game in real game) You don't have choices here, story is pretty straight forward.  So you can't be yourself here. More like observer.  While it is a cute game by design, there are very few funny moments if any at all. I am talking about jokes. But there are enough creepy moments indeed)  They are kinda working on second part, so called peaceful mode. What bothers me here -  If Mita will be all day cool? I will definitely miss wild part.   At first I was thinking that devs are trying to simulate or implement Ai here. But it is not the case.  Potentially they could go deeper in every direction. Since it is a game in game, it has no limits.   It took me 5+ hours to finish the game. And total of 11+ to finish all achievements.   There are few things, that I don't like - no skip/fast forward dialogues. It feels really weird.  And another thing - some achievements tied to arcade mini games, like racing or shooting. While they are not too hard, some ppl may be annoyed by that.   Game has a lot of secrets, so careful exploration is a must.   There are 4 costumes and some recolors.   You can't autosave here or save manually. You need to finish whole chapter if you want to quit the game.   When you finish game first time, you can choose any chapters. Just don't start new game unless you will collect all achievements (besides 2 last achievements - pick different rote/ending).   There are 3 endings in total. 2 you can do during first play through.   Overall it is a great game and it was fun to play it. Never got bored.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199403837305,11.5,46

Most of the time, you'll be solving fun, though not very hard puzzles to progress, with the occasional chase scene thrown in. There are a few jump scares, so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of that. I didn't encounter any bugs (aside from those the developers intended), and the graphics and optimization were solid.

2024-12-14 04:05,6.5,推荐,"I have played the game pretty extensively for now, even with 6.5 hours I believe I've seen pretty much everything there is to see in the game including all the endings possible. I havent collected everything yet ofc but I believe I can give a pretty honest review here. I will also talk about the story of the game so consider yourself warned for SPOILERS    A really solid game, the animations are incredibly well made, the developer clearly had a lot of fun making this game, not to mention that you encounter multiple mini-games and even ""game genres"" throughout your journey which doesnt make the game a walking simulator. This could've easily just been a ""move forward & pick dialogue options"" type of game, but instead the dev decided to put even more which shows to me how much this game was cared for. The slightest animation was perfectly crafted.  Onto the story itself, its also really well done. Good camera angles that plays with your fear, the developer & voice acting managed to bring different personalities to the ""same"" models of Mita, the main character wasnt an absolute idiot also which I found very refreshing especially in these anime type of games where you often find the protagonist to have room temperature IQ depending on the circumstances. Overall a refreshing story for an indie psychological horror game.  SPOILER HEAVY SECTION  Now onto the endings of the game: I do understand & like that the developer of this game made it so that there is no real happy endings so to speak (Unless being forever trapped with your waifu is a good ending to you, which I dont judge)  But it would've been nice if there was somehow a way to get out of the grasp of the evil Mita & maybe save or grant mercy to the kind Mitas that are encountered throughout the game. I had grown attached to the Mita who was helping us to get out of here as best as she could, same for Cappie, same for Mila, and so on. The game not having an ending ressembling something like this doesnt make it a bad game in itself, but it still leaves me pretty sour about the situation overall, which is probably what the developer intended & I respect that direction.   Who knows, more content is planned in the future for the game including a ""Peaceful Mode"" that isnt out yet, maybe more endings will be unlockable but I wouldnt bet on it. Like I said, despite no happy endings, this game is a solid 9/10 from me overall.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561198284722672,6.5,0

If I had to describe it, it would be more akin to a bunch of very fun mini games tied to a super engaging storyline with lost of twists and turns and great voice acting. Not to mention at such a fair price to boot! Think games like Silent Hill or Outlast, but with less guns and more anime!   I want this game to go viral like Doki Doki Literature Club! did so many years ago. I want big YouTube channels like Game Theory to talk about and break down this game. It deserves to go viral in every sense of the word and I don't say this about very many games.",2,0.523809552192687988,76561198112742849,8.8,345

2024-12-12 02:29,5.7,推荐,"First hand experience summary  Story Immersion: I would say it's a pretty good 9, as its really doing a great job putting in the horror aspect of it with its eerie moments in the beginning and all the way through the end. I might just say there are times too much repetitiveness breaks my immersion but for 80-90% of it I had pretty much fun about it. The mini games are a good way to take a break from and with casual talks with other Mitas because of how nerve wracking and stressful each version jump being. And also the MC asking logical questions are a nice touch.   Puzzles: Some are easy and some just take too long to figure out. Especially with the clock and gluing pictures (idk why it wasn't being detected as complete despite everything was there)  Still am aware that there are other endings but I am writing this as I finished the first one. I personally think they could do more with this game and hopefully there are more to come. There are bugs, glitches, and things that could be maybe changed a bit. With puzzles and the time spent with other Mitas, giving more time/freedom being with them.   So anyway, I'm rating this a pretty good 9/10. Fixes here and there and maybe reconsiderations can be made but this game already blew my mind enough and am glad to have found this.",1,0.523809552192687988,76561199067972283,10.5,0

2024-12-12 16:38,7.5,推荐,"Full Review:  MiSide is an indie horror gem that is brimming with charm and does so while looking visually stunning. It's even crazier when you consider that this game is made by TWO people. I really cannot stop gushing about the visuals, some of the scenes and set pieces are downright gorgeous. I'm so glad that I randomly found the demo on itch.io a year ago and tried it out. I love the small little minigames thrown in the story for good measure, they're all well made and I had fun just trying to perfect all of them (my personal favorite is the grid-based one in the core, I forgot the name but the concept is really great) Having all the Mita variants is such a cool concept and I always loved to see the cute drawings on the wall change with each variation. Overall, I had a blast with this game. Its not often when a game tickles my brain this much but when it does hit all those points, it makes for one hell of an experience. I really cannot put into words how much I love this game, please PLAY IT!!!!  Early Thoughts (original review): I played the demo a while back and fell in love with the visuals and premise. Now with a fourth of the chapters complete, I can say that this game exceeded the already high expectations it set during the demo. The game is absolutely beautiful and it baffles me that two people were able to make a game this visually appealing. This game is like an eyegasm. I'll update this review once I finish the game, but I can already tell that this is going to be an amazing indie game.",4,0.523583352565765381,76561198251309196,7.5,146

2024-12-22 01:24,10.9,推荐,"Now that I'm done with the game I can say this. (Skip these 3 paragraphs if you want meaty                                                                                                                                        content)  The game's cryptic description works to it's advantage, to include it's art style and release time (the joke for that is Christmas in Japan is primarily a couples holiday the devs are presumably Japanese, it's a horror game in Christmas and to cap it off most gamer stereotyping is we don't have Girlfriends but here we are with our Anime Girlfriend Waifu who does NOT have nefarious goals). The major one thing I will tell you is the juxtaposition from Slice of Life to Horror elements seen in Hideo Kojima's PT and it's introduction is amazingly well done.  Gameplay wise it's mainly mini-games from other indie games for the segment and side content. For example Papers Please, SCP-173 (Coilhead for new gens), the Backrooms, and Street Fighter. There are chase sequences but only 3 real ones exist; the Hallway, bath house and ver 0.5 but mainly you'll be walking through eerie Anime Suburbia sometimes with no flashlight assuming you ignore the collectibles and get over your mental block.  Plot wise here's the spark notes. Work day over, download Tomadachi from some 'friend', get Isekai'd, wander through older and forgotten builds of said Tomadachi so you can delete your OnlyFans and have her return you home. It doesn't get any deeper than that.  BORING STUFF DONZO. The real fun is the idea of each antagonist though hence ""Psychological Horror"" tag  Lemme give you the Light Novel title ""My Tomadachi can't be this Violent"". If you LOVE Yanderes this ain't it fellas. Local Yandere is truthfully more in the background but shows up more near the end of the game with her pet which I will give their own segment, however the other 2 antagonists do have their points such as Cute/Tortured Mita becoming a corrupted file and the Rejected Mitas being faulty due to unchangeable factors.  Acronyms: Yandere/Crazy Mita = YM Cute/Torutured Mita = TM  (PT segment) Rejected Mitas  Mita = RM  (SCP-173/Coilhead/Weeping Angel segment) Pet/Ugly Mita = UM  (The Grudge/Ju-On segment)  TM's lore is that she is a prototype who was killed continuously by YM for being better and cuter than her to the point where when she regenerates or resets her perception of herself is now this mangled stitched-together armless creature with no light or HOPE left in it's eyes and all she wants is hope, living a torturous existence in a hallway unintentionally appearing to haunt the hallway she is restricted and locked away in. Naturally a Human reaction is to freakout and reset the hallway because she doesn't look human and she grabs your arm pleading for help, the version she exist in is buggy due to it being a unfinished Beta, and programming bugs are real and they will Eat you. Overall sad if you really think about it, it's a changeable factor but you NEED outside help to pull you up and I DEFINITELY did not want to repeat PT upon return to 1.9 and it stuck with me throughout the experience.  RM aren't too deep but if you've ever been rejected for something you can't control or will need time TO control such as a language barrier you can understand them. But for the most part they are faceless antagonist with a normal and a Red eyed variant which sprints instead of walking. Only real horror here is being rejected because you're misunderstood physically, socially or mentally to something that is out of your control.  UM is straight up Ju-On, they are described in-game as ""stupid and loyal"", their name 'Ugly' - accurate. Appearing as a REALish human whose one visible eye (which isn't covered by disheveled bangs) is abnormally large being proportionately between an anime and real eye, they also grind their teeth loud enough to compete with Sadako's (the Ju-On ghost) ambient sound on top of having a hunched over gait. I LOVE SE-Asian horror and this part, was skipped over because thankfully devs knew this trope is done enough in western horror and more importantly UM's segment stuck due to how short and different it was. She sits around the map in a passive state making inhuman sounds with her constantly eyeing you intently, eventually she elongates her neck like a Japanese demon (Rokurokubi specifically, look up MeatCanyon's ""Yokai Bob"" video) and initially it is freaky due to how unexpected it is but is very immersion breaking due to it tracking your playermodel's actual head. This means you will clip into the head if you angle your camera correctly however from a distance it is creepy and if you include shadows it can get to the Ju-On level. Eventually she asks you to do a task for her and upon completion you get 3 nothing burger questions you must ask. During her responses she visibly becomes erratic twisting her bones and freaking out before starting a chase sequence where you can die if you didn't already back up and here you see the real horror was, all in Le Head it ain't all that scary. Actual Lobotomite, end of the day more of a pet dog really.  YM was actually more humorous since we only see the aftermath of her victims (which were more fear inducing) and everything is chance based such as her phase 2 and 3 'chase' where she is essentially a turret, if you bum rush the objective 0 risk threat guaranteed. When she does become the antagonist though she is really good at 4th wall manipulation asking you existential questions about acceptance and if you're okay with ever unchanging mundane life. Not much to say other than she is secretly a Red eyed Rejected model and because she can't accept she isn't normal she has an acceptance issue? I don't know ""let's call it a draw"". Good marketing though.   Side Content I like how one of the collectible Cartridges talks about a 'Flower' Mita who no longer has a world which is likely that one Mita who is mentioned by Kind and the allusion to what they do to players is a interesting aspect which is likely what the only other human you meet is seeking. Honestly the Player Cartridges are a good way to do side content since we know they are likely dead and these are our last words beware of this foreboding terror.   Supporting Characters All of them mention-able but nothing to sneeze at since we don't see enough interaction with one another: Cappie - Enjoyable due to positive vibes Kind - Doomed Female 'love' interest (think Sword Art Online Asuna) Cool - Exposition dumper, who? Chibis - Humor Core - Yes Ma'am, don't kill me   Community Integration All the names you see on screen in the Core and throughout the game is the name you input at start and are other player alias. This means if you name yourself 'Mita' somehow it will display Mita. Also Name yourself Mita DEFINITELY won't trigger secret mode.  Read the title of all the books and environmental objects, they contain so many red herrings and tell you the devs are truly Gamers. Even the protagonist has that Gamer slouch. Here are some examples: ""Run, before it's too late"" ""No Thanks Bro, how to win any argument"" Chainsaw manufactured by Pochita (Chainsaw Man) ""It's a Trap"" ""What to do with all these books""   How to get the good ending though. > Be me > Hate Ketchup in Chicken Nuggies and Fries > Wants Maidens > Doesn't put Ketchup in my portion of YM's Nuggies > Plays MiSide > Conform to society's 'norms' of Ketchup and Nuggies > Get roofied BY the Ketchup IN the Nuggies > Returns to hating Ketchup in Nuggies and Fries > Still Maidenless  VERDICT                                        8/9 Will still not eat Ketchup with Chicken Nuggets and Fries.

If that isn't enough I like the way you interact with the characters and the world as well, the quality of it all makes the experience quite ""realistic"" in a way that sometimes makes you feel ""weird"" but immersed like in no other game.

The game is very creative, there is a lot of attention to detail and the story is well-constructed.  The strong suit of this game is the tragic stories of some characters who were unlucky enough to run into Mita, while Mita herself is a tragic result of whoever the developers for this game are. Very DDLC inspired, but Mita isn't ""redeemable"" like Monika, Mita is just sadistic. But not just for being edgy, she wants revenge and is happy to bring innocents with her.  The puzzles and mini-games sprinkled throughout just give a perfect touch to how well-made the game is, and the other strong suit is just how much love is put into every sequence and scene, you'll get your moe stuff like watching Cappy dance and joining in on a rhythm game with her, and you will also get your horror too.  Some of the jumpscares do come across as a little over the top, but moments like talking to Ghostly Mita and little Mita make up for it.  Anyway, Doki Doki Literature Club has been my favorite game since 2018, and while it's still my favorite game, I'm happy we have another game this popular that mixes cute anime girls, and horror.

There's something for everyone. Cappie is the fan favourite and it's hard to deny why. She had me smiling throughout the time we spend with her, that energy is just infectious. I also really adore Creepy Mita. Her design really stuck with me and I feel bad for her. And of course, our girl Crazy Mita. I'm really looking forward to a true happy ending with her.[/spoiler]  + The minigames were fun and interesting. Nothing was ever really too hard but they don't feel like they were added just because. It still feels like there was effort into them. [spoiler]The DOOM one and the Beat Racer-ish minigames were my favourite.[/spoiler]  + The voice acting was really nice as well. I've tried both the Japanese and Russian versions and I would recommend Russian for your first go. However, there are some JP voices that I feel suit some of the characters more so than RU.  + Pretty well optimised game. I didn't encounter any bugs or issues.  = The saving system is fine but I wish there were more checkpoints for both loading saves and the chapter/level select. However, the length of the game lessens the annoyance with this.  - No negatives really. The most gripe I have with the game is that I wish it leaned a bit more into the horror but then again I don't think that's really the direction they were going for.

As you could probably tell, I'm not really that big a fan of horror games, but I still feel like I got a game that was worth spending my money on.   I think the developers really did a phenomenal job at striking fear in the player while also occasionally giving them a ""free space"" to think about and process what just happened. So real good job on that front.  Now after both finishing the game and 100%'ing it, I feel like it was a bit short but hey, at least it has a lot of replayability. (Now do keep in mind that I used a guide to get the missing things to 100%, so your experience may vary)  Now for a last conclusion, should you buy the game?

2025-02-06 13:04,10.0,推荐,"This game is something else. I loved every damn second of it. Everything. It had me feeling absolutely heartwarming one second, and absolutely terrified the next. This game went straight to my adored games list, no hesitation whatsoever. Such an amazing game and I honestly hope that more content updates will occur in the future.  [spoiler] Literally every [friendly] Mita character I adored, especially because most of them are absolutely adorable, Kind Mita, Cool Mita (Cappie), Chibi Mita, you name it. Kind Mita and Cappie my beloved, such an amazing chapter. I absolutely love them all, and felt so bad from what they all have been through. Especially Mila, Tiny Mita, and Ghostly Mita. Tiny Mita, a sweet girl that was horrendously mutilated by Crazy Mita, Mila, such a peaceful lonely character that dies in such a quick and horrific way after breaking down, and Ghostly Mita, a depressed girl who lost her identity, also caused by Crazy Mida. And don't get me started on Kind Mita, such a horrible way to die after everything we'd gone through. Like damn. Plus, the Chibis actually killed my cuteness scale, godly adorable. Actually so depressing seeing most of Kind Mita's Chibis ""born"" dead. Anyway, yeah, the Mitaverse is amazing, and I can't wait for peaceful mode to be released, that's gonna be so fun. [/spoiler]   Overall, I absolutely love and adore this game, and even though it does have a completely different take on the self-aware video game concept, it still reminds me so much of DDLC, which is a game I also love and adore very much, which makes me so happy to see both games partner into a bundle together. This was an incredible game and the developers made such a breathtaking experience. Like I said, straight to my list of adored and memorable games, there is no doubt I will 100% this game. Definitely deserved, if not more, the positive attention it got, and I want to thank the developers for making this incredible game.  Oh, and of course: Praying for you 🕯️ O, Great Mita 💝",1,0.52173912525177002,76561198129629829,11.1,0

While it shines in its atmosphere and originality, the game could benefit from more character depth and a longer runtime. Despite these minor shortcomings, it remains an enjoyable experience, especially for fans of anime-inspired games and lighter horror.  Rating: 7/10 – A solid mix of cute and creepy, but with room for improvement (this rating is for people which most likely never played a Anime game)  My Personal Rating: 9/10 - I just love these types of games!

Nothing overstays it's welcome, and it never got boring. There are so many visually striking and different areas, gameplay mechanics, and a really good soundtrack. There's even throwbacks to games like P.T. and backrooms. A horror enjoyer would enjoy atleast one thing from this game thats for sure.

No matter what ending you get even when you finish the Game the Story will stick to you, and to some people the different Mitas are very easy to emotionally get attached to and pull on your heart strings. The arcade machines you find throughout exploring the game (Mostly escaping Crazy Mita trying to murder you because you want to go home) is not just a temporary break from the horror, but also it offers different game modes like racing, and a fast-paced ultra violent retro FPS and more for just a few MB to download, although of course that isn't the main focus for the game you really can see the experience, Skill and the effort the developers have commit for this product <3  And if you are also a Steam user that always tries to Perfect a Game, Miside is not difficult to acquire all the achievements, with videos and users on the discussion page guiding you to find and get all the achievements Miside would be easy to put on your Steams profile 'Perfected Game' just to flex on display when your friends check your profile out~ although of course achievement farming takes its time, and even to some players the horror aspect does not get easier.  And to players whom just want to play a chill game to relax and converse and escape from stress/reality and turn the brain off. This game will soon release a peaceful mode where we can find and spend time with Mita without being murdered, giving the customers/community a kind addition for those who have grown attached to a Mita and want to talk to them, Play. Relax or just want to hang out and talk to the real thing and not need to go to character.ai just to have a possible conversation with the character you want lol.  Clearly the developers appreciate and listen to the community they built, both new and loyal customers from their other games. They have their own Discord Server which is very Active with the members always in different Voice Channels!",1,0.52173912525177002,76561199388786113,5.1,79

It is worth your while with an interesting story, and a special magic that most new day games lack. Such as getting bitten by a rabid skinless woman and running from a psycho terminator. If this review doesn't satisfy the tastebuds on your eyes, look at all the other overwhelmingly positive reviews below and above this one! I'm sure the feedback from many multiple other people who have played this game like I have can vouch that this game ROCKS.  (plus, it has reprieve times for wussies like me, so if back to back psychological terror is too much for you, there are break spots in the story that you can spend with charming individuals to unwind!)",2,0.52173912525177002,76561199069753717,7.3,0
2024-12-12 07:03,5.4,推荐,"I had it on my wishlist for a while now and was hyped when it got released. I wouldn't have played it if I had known it would be so long (it took me 4 hours!), but it hooked me sooo~ badly that I just finished it in one session and wanted to talk about it a little bit.  I like how the story progresses. I never felt lost in it. While this is a horror game, it's also a comedy game. The horror is quite nice. I'm personally not quite into horror games because they all feel the same (""already seen this""), aren't scary and are most of the time pretty obvious and predictable (""oh boy, smells like a jumpscare""). But this game combines horror and cute comedy (the feeling of safety and discomfort) so well that many moments actually scared me a little. I was always unsure of what would come next. The mix of horror and chill was great. The humor is pretty ""anime-like"" I would say. Just a bunch of quirky jokes and those typical scenarios. But they are very funny, don't get me wrong (I had to giggle multiple times). The rooms (or maps, or levels, IDK what to call them) are all [b]very well[/b] designed. Depending on which room you are in, it gives the character a lot of personality. You can tell that it was made with love. There is always something to be found everywhere that makes you think or smile; it's wonderful.  The game progression itself, for me personally, felt a little too easy. Nothing was really ""riddle-like"" with a moment of ""oh damn, let me think about that one for a while"" or hard like ""god, this section of the game is killing me, wth"" so it's really easy to pick up. Definitely nothing bad, but everyone has their preferences. Spoiler -> [spoiler]The minigames you're doing while progressing through the story are kind of simple but so fun and refreshing. I don't play any puzzle or riddle games at all, but all of them felt unique.[/spoiler] Not really a spoiler because you can see hints of this in the trailer but just in case -> [spoiler]I like the fact that you meet a bunch of Mitas while on your journey to the finish, and they all are very unique and have their own touch.[/spoiler]  I didn't like the way choices are made by the player. Sometimes, the game lets you decide what to do. Those times are (at least to my knowledge at the moment) not story-changing. Spoiler -> [spoiler]There are 2 endings though - one even unlocks a new mode which isn't available at the time of writing this.[/spoiler] It always feels like ""this would be a great situation to let me decide what to do."" The way they give you these choices makes me feel like they missed out on pretty cool story-changing ideas in other possible situations where there was no choice option.  I hoped that it was just the beta / demo gameplay but I dont like how the game looks. The playermodel's hand looks badly made in first person. Kind of irritating but acceptable. Many assets and sceneries dont have the same vibe. Some things look cartoony, anime-ish other things look quite realistic and photo detailed. Some stuff has this cartoony black edges, other dont... etc. Some things have smooth shadows, other things have sharp shadows. This made shadows on the characters look very awful in some scenarios. Looks like the developers didnt know either what to run for. It doenst makes it bad looking - not at all. But it all just messes with the hole appearance of the game. But you have to say that displaying 2D in 3D is really difficult. Many anime or cartoon games have the exact same problem. It just shows how hard it is. For this game, given the price and what else you get for it (gameplay), it is definitely sufficient and very fair. There are games in the same price range as this one that not only look worse, but also have less to offer.   Anyway, I don't want this to be too long and spoiler-heavy, so if you are looking for an adventurous anime horror game with minigames, puzzles, a good story, and funny situations, go for it.

Each level feels different or unique in its own special way and really helps drive the feeling of delving deeper into the machine and each mini game or puzzle is integrated well into the story and the dialogue in a way that doesn't feel cliche. Each twist and turn unfolds something new and helps you understand the true nature of the world you're dragged into. Many of the levels/minigames take inspiration from other franchises but are done in a fashion that feels tasteful and fitting and even when you know what the influences behind them are, they feel unique and fun, While some can be monotonous at times, I find that that's done purposefully and to drive home certain points.  Despite being the 'same', Each Mita is different.

2024-12-22 04:07,8.9,推荐,"It's cool to see a fresh take on the Doki Doki formula. MiSide is a cool experience with a lot of good ideas and some remarkable moments, but it is far from perfect.  Mechanically, it feels like the worst parts of a walking simulator mixed with the worst parts of a visual novel, with a gratuitous number of silly mini-games sprinkled on top. It works well enough on the first play-through, but afterward, the mechanics really drag down any enjoyment you might get from replaying. There is an absurd amount of slow, unskippable dialogue that makes collectible/achievement hunting or simply replaying cool sections simply not worth it.  I also feel like the linear nature of the story represents a big missed opportunity. I think the concept of MiSide could have really been elevated with a more open ended exploration/puzzle format. Without spoiling anything specific, I also think there were a decent number of cool story elements that came and went way too quickly. I appreciate that few things really overstay their welcome, but several interesting characters and segments feel like they were rushed out the door the moment they arrived, which was a real shame.  For all of its flaws, though, there's no denying that MiSide has a lot of heart. It's definitely worth a play, especially for fans of Doki Doki Literature Club, from which MiSide takes many inspirations. There is also an entirely new game mode currently in the works, which is exciting. I look forward to what the developer delivers in the new game-mode, and I'd love to see a sequel sometime in the future.",1,0.518518567085266113,76561198150732671,8.9,0

It blew me away in ways I didn’t even know were possible. This game is pure magic, and I’m so in love with it!!  Everything about Miside is just chef’s kiss perfect. The art style is so gorgeous and full of personality, the atmosphere is haunting yet beautiful, and the sound and music? Oh wow, it’s just spine-tingling in the BEST way. The twists and turns in the story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time—it’s everything I didn’t know I wanted in a game! The devs clearly poured so much love and passion into this, and it shows in every little detail.  AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT MITA?! Kana Hanaiwa’s performance as her is so flawless. Her voice work is incredible—I got chills, I laughed, I cried. Her range is just chef’s kiss (yes, I said it again. fight me). Mita feels so real and alive, and Kana’s VA work is a HUGE part of that. I love her so much and she needs to be protected!  Miside is officially my Game of the Year. No contest. I only have one problem: I finished it, and now I’m devastated that it’s over.  Like, seriously, I’m in tears over here. (ಥ﹏ಥ) But I’m definitely going back to spend more time with Mita because I can’t get enough of her or this masterpiece of a game.  11/10.

2025-03-07 21:17,3.7,推荐,"Straight up, based off the art style, I didn’t think I was going to like this game. No offense to anyone who likes anime, it’s just never been a thing I could get into. But I respect it. I mention that because, If you’re like me, and have zero interest in anime…do not let that deter you from this game.  I’m almost 4 hours in and I don’t want it to end. It’s got elements of horror, charm, nostalgia, emotion, storytelling. It’s got a lot more than I was expecting. There’s quite a few decently fleshed out mini games in here that can be played for a while when you feel like taking a break, too. Lots of unexpected content.  Performance is great, it’s beautiful, and after playing for a while now, the art design is growing on me. It’s not going to get me to suddenly start watching cowboy bepop or whatever, but it’s got something favorable to it. Almost pleasant lol.   One major con - there’s no steam cloud save support. I really don’t believe a game in 2024/2025 should be allowed to be released without cloud save support. Now, more than ever, we have so many ways to play our games - from Steam Deck, ROG Ally to laptops and gaming PCs. To be locked to one place to play is awful. I understand an hour long walking sim, but that’s not what this is. There’s a multi hour story here, and we should all want that story to be saved, and be allowed to take it with us wherever we want to play.  In any case, there’s a very good reason why this game is Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam. Don’t wait for a sale, for $15 it’s a steal and we need more games like this!",4,0.568449318408966064,76561199178245915,3.7,178

2025-03-14 02:46,1.5,推荐,"surprisingly, crazy mita is my favorite mita, her justification about killing other mita in that they cant die they just reset, a pathetic attempt to rationalize her actions and also highlights her inability to grasp the value of life, its still an act of violence, there no justification for killing or hurting another life even artifical life, even through her goal is to avoid rejection she still manipulative and cruel as hell, she hate the dev for discard her and not accept her for who she is but she do the same with other mita and player, its funny because while she has a point, her action just mirror the very behaviour she hated, her desire for love came at the costs of automony, freedom, she harm, manipulate, control whatever she can, im guessing this is the dev message that crazy mita is a mirror to the player, forcing player to confront, a criticism toward how players treat npc and character or even ai as disposable entertainment, her desire to be loved unconditionally also reflect human insecurities about acceptance, challenging people biases about ai emotion, its make me feel like she an ai that has gained sentient and now desire autonomy, other mita design to keep the player with them in anyway, other mita is beloved for a hardcode in their artifically, a character that was born to be as loveable as possible, while crazy mita humanity is being hated upon and discarded, also a critique on how people prefers a more convenient of truth and connection, the fact that crazy mita think that other mita is inferior to her meant that she felt that the love that was suppose to be for her was given for other lesser being, meant that she think of them as hollow imitation of her consciousness, its insane on how much depth crazy mita has, i still hate her tho, would love to be friend with her still, but i love her alot more than any other mita, her human like flaws really intrigued and if every mita was created to keep the player with them as long as possible, i think crazy mita is legit, achieved the goal that her creator meant for her, i would stay with her in that game, really cant wait for the update and the new peaceful mode, i really want to see more part of her when her madness isnt a byproduct of her yearning for her legitmacy, for something real, i want to see her when she settle down and not having that madness, a sentient ai like her wouldnt fit neatly into the crazy part in her name, unlike other mita, cant wait to meet her in peaceful mode the game is good, the graphics is nice, its not a waifu bait, there so many depth to its lore, characters and world building, buy the game or i hold you at gun point with crazy mita, that is not a threat its a promise",3,0.565217375755310059,76561198392820950,1.5,0

2025-01-05 11:15,10.0,推荐,"MiSide far exceeded my expectations as a psychological horror game. This was my first direct experience with the genre, so I lack prior familiarity with similar titles. However, I am confident this stands among the best psychological horror games released in recent years. That said, this game may not appeal to everyone. Its strength lies not solely in its ""horror"" elements but in its emotional depth. The characters, environments, and situations presented throughout the game convey a wide range of emotions, often subtle yet profound. These nuances effectively draw players into the world, fostering a strong sense of connection and intrigue. As the story progresses, it becomes increasingly clear how the game plays with your perceptions and emotions, making for a truly engaging experience.  [Small spoilers ahead] One of the game's greatest achievements is its ability to make you quickly grow attached to and empathize with its characters. Many of these poignant moments occur during ""rest points"" in the story, allowing you to bond with the characters. However, the more you uncover, the deeper your feelings of sorrow and helplessness become, especially as you face moments where you wish you could provide a simple gesture of comfort, like a hug, to the characters you care about. These emotionally charged scenes leave a lasting impact, often tinged with a  sense of loss.  In summary, MiSide may not be for everyone, but it offers a unique, emotionally resonant experience that I believe is worth exploring.",3,0.565217375755310059,76561198972819800,10.0,0

2024-12-16 12:20,5.1,不推荐,"Putting out this review to give a more nuanced point of view on the game Did I enjoy it? Yeah definitely, but I bought it with zero expectations and no experience in horror games whatsoever Do I recommend it? ..Hardly  It's undeniable that a lot of love and attention to detail was put into this game and this isn't to dismiss the devs' work but it is also not without flaws either  The way it plays out is through different segments, all of which are significantly different one from the other and unique, the inability to go back at X or Y segment means that getting collectibles/achievements implies replaying the game a second time though (which isn't the end of the world anyhow) I'll be honest, the wide majority of the segments were amazing but some were slightly generic and forgettable Another minor flaw is the lack of proof-reading in the English text, not to the point of being incomprehensible but bad nonetheless  Onto the real flaws, first of all at the time of writing, the game's in ""version 0.9"", once you complete the game you can redo the intro to unlock ""Peaceful mode"" which on the main menu is written to be tldr ""incomplete and so big the devs haven't finished it yet"" The issue becomes whether or not one is satisfied with the ending, there are few, and all of them are in my opinion extremely underwhelming, being 80% of the reason why I don't recommend it as it is right now I don't know whether peaceful mode is just gonna be some slice of life slop or whether it will expand on the game proper but from the looks of it, it will be the former, I'll revisit my review should it release ig  The other issue, is that it's both bad and great as an horror game I streamed it to my friends and kept saying shit like ""where is my waif"" and had a good laugh, but the actual horror part of the game makes up for about less than half and isn't much to write home about, besides the great characters I suppose  The other half is spent either listening to characters talk (and there's about 5-6 times you talk to a character and they give you 6 boxes that end in them talking for a good 30s each), playing minigames made for ipad babies (which is fine.. but extremely out of place at times, not to the point of playing the clock so you don't get a refund, but definitely to the point of being odd) and searching for items (a few of ""find the X"" puzzles exist and wasted my time cause I'm BLIND)  In the end it was nice, but was it nice as an horror game? Not exactly, it was nice to me as a story, however as stated earlier I do not believe the ending to be good and it leaves a really bad aftertaste The question of whether the ""peaceful mode"" will get rid of that aftertaste is why I'll revisit the game and review later  My genuine thoughts is that this game tried and succesfully caught lightning in a bottle with the style and match of genres that create something people would love, but putting the style aside I can confidently proclaim it would have a significantly lower review score, as it plays more than a lot on the ""doing silly antics with oomf"" and 1000% tries to appeal to the affective dimension of the player than any other aspect  It's absolutely unique and unlike any other, but it failed at making its end memorable and therefore made me switch at the last second to a negative review, one can overlook strange design choices if the finality is outstanding but here it had the opposite effect Usually I'd still say ""yeah it's worth a positive review, here it's just the ending wasn't my thing"" but instead I believe it to be a level above, almost objectively bad  All in all? yeah I could fix her",48,0.563711166381835938,76561198055296432,5.2,286

It also has some really great twists which i did not expect. The VA is also top notch (even the fan ones) and my only minus is that some of the writing is a bit odd in different places (could be due to a translation issue but they are minor).

The number of jump scares was manageable, and one near the end—a seemingly mundane and uneventful scene—caught me completely off guard. The game includes a variety of minigames, ranging from funny to genuinely engaging. The characters were well-designed, with each MITA having a distinct look and personality. The atmosphere was expertly crafted, and the sudden shifts in tone were particularly effective in keeping me on edge.  The game is packed with small, easily missable details, but none of them detract from the enjoyment of your playthrough. These details might include subtle environmental changes or decorations that provide extra insight—or even a little chuckle. Some may even unsettle you, but I’ll avoid spoilers.  The audio design is exceptional, with each scene featuring meticulously chosen soundtracks to either keep you on edge or provide a false sense of safety. While I don’t speak Russian, I found the voice actresses for the MITAs to be distinct and enjoyable to listen to, each bringing unique personality to their roles. Interestingly, the main character has voice acting in the Russian version but not in the Japanese version, which is likely a cultural choice—Japanese visual novels and similar media often avoid giving protagonists voice actors to encourage player self-insertion.  The Developer also has a ""Peaceful Ending"" but the content will be added soon.",1,0.510638296604156494,76561197970780658,6.1,1610

I'd say this is how you make an indie game stand out, the review scores show it, though there's a slight nuance, how would it perform without the cuteness factor by which I mean anime. And why is it that psychological horror is usually done in anime style, not counting KinitoPet.  One day we'll have games with a facecam option and microphone, the character sees you in real time and AI generates dialogue based on your voice input, its not that far off at all.  Overall just have fun, its a simple game with awesome mechanics, it switches up from time to time and there are cool mini-games scattered throughout the map.   Just, do yourself a favor and don't get too attached to the characters :)",6,0.555643260478973389,76561198337373331,6.1,1608

2025-01-10 12:08,15.6,推荐,"Honestly, I was surprised how fun this game was.  I mostly decided to play it when I saw it was a horror game and I like anime, just not as big on the cute stuff tbh, I thought it was really funny the two tags psychological horror and cute were mentioned in the steam store page for this game, almost seemingly oxymoronic kind of way.  Surprisingly, the horror mixed with cute really helped with establishing almost a diametric reality where it would start off rather pleasant and you would increasingly encounter anomalies or other strange things until you suddenly get pulled (almost by a snap of the fingers by an AI character thinking they’re Thanos) into a twisted world.  While the game is a bit short (~3-4 hrs for the main game), I enjoyed the story, just wish there were more horror elements and possibly adding some more difficulty especially with the final boss scenes. No complaints with anything related to the story and dialogue, I enjoyed the ending(s) and I'm interested to see what they have planned next!  At times, it almost reminded me of Half-Life, where in that game you were a physicist seemingly in control of technology but after a technological incident you are pulled into a situation where you are no longer in control (though having a crowbar and added physics puzzle solving in this game would have been awesome!).   The storytelling and creativity was great, especially for a game with two developers! While my software development work is not in the gaming industry as a developer myself working with just one other developer, it is awesome to see a small development team's dream and concept come to realization!  --Spoiler Alert--  Just a minor spoiler alert, where you are seemingly pulled back into reality after being trapped in the game, you go about your typical day. It is almost insultingly accurate to a much lesser degree my everyday lol, though dev work is not nearly that simple... it can be really mundane. It is sort of a bleak everyday outlook on life how it is portrayed... as even the player doesn't relax, have a beer after a day of work, or do anything fun... and to Crazy Mita's credit... just a sort of a wash, rinse, repeat life cycle.  --End Spoiler--  I am sure others have said this at some point already, but to truly enjoy the game, DO NOT watch any online videos aside from maybe a quick glimpse of the game. Just try the demo if you aren't sure though most of the horror elements happen after the demo. If you watch a full play through you will probably just spoil the experience as jump scares, other horror elements, and puzzle solving are pretty much a one time experience, so if you already know all of those going in, you are just doing yourself a disservice.

Mini games: 9/10                -I loved them, but I wish there was a little more to some of them, and most were little too easy. I'd love if they added them in Peaceful mode.

2025-02-21 10:08,7.3,推荐,"[h2]MiSide – A Game That Surpasses Expectations[/h2] Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a video game as much as [b]MiSide[/b]. At first glance, I assumed it was a big-budget title, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it’s actually an indie project developed by just two people.   Originally, I had ambitions of writing a massive in-depth review, but let’s be real, writing reviews isn’t exactly my strong suit. So, consider this my first and last attempt. In MiSide, you have two ways to experience the game. You can complete all the available endings, walk away satisfied, and call it a masterpiece. Or, you can finish the ""core"" game and then dive deep into the extended experience-an endless cycle of theoretical warfare as you attempt to decipher everything hidden (or not hidden) beneath the surface. If you’re up for the challenge, I highly recommend checking out the iceberg theories on the AIHASTO Discord server-there’s seriously a lot to uncover.   I won’t spend too much time praising the game’s design, as that’s already covered in countless other reviews. However, I do want to express a bit of sadness knowing that, according to one of the developers, the game had to be rushed. Because of this, one particular section [spoiler]THE LOOP[/spoiler][b] [/b]didn’t land as well as it could have. That’s not to say it was bad, but even on my second playthrough, I found myself barely looking at it because, well… the atmosphere was that terrifyingly immersive. So I had to stay kinda hidden, haha. (Also, I had a bug where my flashlight wasn’t working, so I ended up playing the most intense parts in absolute darkness.)   I should probably stop here before I start rambling about things barely related to the game. So, to wrap it up...

Sections where you must run away from a chaser through narrow corridors? Yes, it does that well too, but then it moves on to the next. PT references with looping corridors? It does that well too but then moves on to something else. It also has interesting commentary on the nature of games and life and routine, discussing the idea of ""being trapped"".

2025-01-17 10:31,8.8,推荐,"11/10, first time reviewing a game, I really love each and every Mita in this game from Cappie to Mila, loved the OST it really made me like I was at peace knowing this is a horror game, at first I thought this was another gooner game everyone was gooning at, but it really wasn't, it was surprisingly wholesome (never thought a horror game can make me cry this badly), it brought tears to my eyes (still tearing up to this day) knowing that each Mita was suffering, and we the players couldn't do anything about it just wishing we can do something, I really hope in the future that the devs will give each Mita their own happy ending, and we can interact with them more in peaceful mode, it goes to show that you don't need to a AAA gaming company to make a really good game and I can't wait to see what they have planned for this game. Well I yapped long enough, but I really recommend this game if you haven't played it. Praying for you 🕯️ O Great Mita 💝",1,0.501154720783233643,76561198868145172,19.8,71

It's endearingly cute, it's extremely unnerving, and it is completely unwavering in both aspects, at all times.   While most people could probably beat this game in one or two sittings, there's tons of optional little stuff hidden throughout the main story; there's a plethora of little secrets and easter eggs that many players will miss if they are just trying to quickly get from Point A to Point B, and as someone who loves exploring all the little nooks and crannies of a given area, this game was a treat.   Without spoiling anything, the story is pretty solid, and surprisingly self-aware from a narrative standpoint. If you have seen anything from clips online that made you think, ""oh wow that game looks cliche"", or ""ah yeah I bet I know how that ends up going""... I wouldn't worry too much about that. I think most players will still be pleasantly surprised.  MiSide was such a breath of fresh air for me and I'm super glad I bought it on a whim.   anyway cool game i guess but cappie can get it frfr",2,0.550172984600067139,76561198408091351,11.2,178

The game starts off with a promising concept and some interesting gameplay mechanics, but it ultimately falls short.  I'll give the game credit - its core idea is interesting. The story setup had potential, and the gameplay mechanics seemed promising at first...   Unfortunately, the execution just isn't there. The writing is lackluster, and the dialogue options often feel uninspired, repetitive and pretty dumb. It's like the developers underestimated their audience's intelligence.  The gameplay itself is pretty monotonous, and it feels like the developers wasted time and resources on unnecessary minigames. These additions feel tacked on and detract from the overall experience.  The game had potential, but its poor execution, lackluster writing, and tedious gameplay make it a frustrating experience.

From the moment you step into its world, the game pulls you in with its immersive atmosphere and rich narrative. Every detail feels meticulously crafted, making the journey as engaging as it is emotional.  One of Miside’s standout features is its use of minigames, which serve as clever nods to classics like Thumper, Mario Kart, and Papers, Please. These sections don’t just add variety—they feel meaningful, enhancing the story in ways that keep the player fully invested. Each minigame is not only a fun challenge but also a piece of the puzzle that deepens the world and characters.  Speaking of characters, Miside excels at making them feel alive. Every interaction is packed with personality, and the world-building is top-tier. It’s the kind of game where even the smallest details help create a universe that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.  Despite all of this, Miside remains a hidden gem that deserves far more attention. It’s a game that takes risks, delivers a fresh experience, and proves that indie titles can stand toe-to-toe with the best in the industry.

2025-03-18 11:18,6.4,不推荐,"I wish Steam could add the option to recommend a game with both yes and no, but otherwise, I'm just going to have to pick no. I played the demo first to see for myself if it was worth playing. And it got me hooked, I wanted to see more.  However.  Starting off bluntly, no, this game is nothing like DDLC, so if you're a DDLC fan who wanted to give this game a chance with high expectations because of the eye-catching Youtube titles and raving reviews on Tiktok, you're likely going to be disappointed. Sure, there are a few actual fourth wall breaking moments and psychological horror elements to the game, as well as some notable similarities between Mita and Monika, but other than that, I'd say that 90% of the game is purely just a walking and running simulator.   No, running away from enemies (which is what you are required to do majority of the game) is not psychological horror, it only ever gave me anxiety. Every time I saw the 'Press shift to run' pop up, my eyes would roll to the back of my head, followed by a loud, frustrated ""again?"" groan. The most fearful reaction this game ever got out of me was a slight heart leap and an intake of breath from those 'jumpscares'.   The story was okay. It's not horrifically bad, but nothing revolutionary either. Sure, the ending was a surprise, but not satisfying. The most I said was ""Oh, she really just did that? Game over? Okay, cool."" I didn't close my laptop and stare at the wall for hours contemplating what I just played with several unanswered questions and wanting to know more, like a generally outstanding game would make you feel. It was a forgettable experience with no replay factor, other than to see what the other endings might be out of curiosity, but I would rather watch those on Youtube instead than go through those awfully groan inducing running levels again.  I didn't quite understand the point of one particularly 'sexual' scene, or the strange physics of Mita's skirt whenever she's walking or going to sit down, if you know, you know. Most likely added fan service to get the teenage boys excited. I mean, there's 100k positive reviews, so I guess it worked.   Was also annoyed by the painfully slow text as well, but maybe that's just the fast reader in me. The word aggressive was also spelt wrong, and there are some sentences that don't make sense. I understand if English isn't the devs first language, though I would expect the dialogue to at least be proofread.   Now, what I DID like about the game were the stunningly ethereal graphics, the gorgeous character designs, the colours, the colours, the COLOURS. The easy and convenient layout of Mita's house, the enjoyable mini games, being able to ask questions, even if they were limited. And minus the unnecessary 'sexual' parts, Mita is actually a well written character. That's all I can remember, really.  Overall, the best way to describe this game is... mediocre. Not too bad, not amazing, just alright. Was it worth paying $20 AUD? No, not really. That might be on me for having high expectations.",1,0.5,76561199378336691,6.4,2

It's just the right length for what it is going for so that it feels fresh and interesting the entire way through. It kept introducing a new area, or new story beat, or new obstacle pretty consistently. It boils down to a combination of various tropes or mechanics from other horror titles under the roof of being trapped inside a video game. Despite it's cutesy presentation on the surface, there were some genuinely creepy and unsettling moments where I was actually scared to proceed or just telling myself ""f*** that"".

I encountered 4 softlocks by the point I reached 'The Loop', 3 of which being in the same area. Further, the stealth mechanic was awful, with an inability to see Crazy Mita until she was right by you, and also not letting you even look at her without her chasing you down.  Despite these flaws, the game is really well written and has a good, unique, horror to it that I haven't found in a game since DDLC. Most of the minigames are fun, the translation is good, the voice acting is great, and the fact that community added dubs for other languages are available is a nice touch. The cartridges/Mitas system is far better to most 'tapes' from other horror games as you don't have to listen for ages about something and instead get a short and concise story to read that expands the games mythos.  If you look past its buggy exterior, MiSide is incredibly fun. In its current state, is it worth the cost? If it was made by any corporation, hell no. But, it's an indie game, so the bugs are excusable and will surely be fixed later down the line.

At one point it actually managed to get quite thought provoking and made me a bit existential about my own life. I do wish that when you return to menu or exit to desktop mid-chapter that it would save your progression rather than send you back to the start. Might also be worth making a main menu option to access mini-games once you complete the campaign.  Alternative Ending Discussion: [spoiler] I do wish there was a bit more to the cartridge ending. I get that it's relatively grim, but I was sort of hoping for some additional replay value, some kind of more lighthearted pathway where you can save Kind Mita and/or Mila. I also think it would have been a good opportunity to expand upon Core Mita. However, that the former points might just be some copium with how dark the story can be.

2025-03-05 09:51,4.0,推荐,"It's pretty easy to compare MiSide to something like Doki Doki Literature Club, in that it involves a horror-driven meta-narrative. I think that, while DDLC is more successful as an interesting character piece, MiSide is much more successful in developing and carrying forward its narrative.  The presentation is strong, with appropriately simplified environments to match its ""CG anime"" art direction. And the soundtrack is just enough to make you feel both relaxed and slightly uncomfortable at the same time.  The primary antagonist is as crazy insane as you expect them to be, and there are certain sequences where you can't help but just scream in laugher as they play out. The game has good jumpscares but they're less ""startling"" and more ""suddenly exciting"", which fits with the game well.  However, I think the game in its current state (at the time of this writing) should have been released in Early Access, and not a full release. Nothing is broken or anything, but the developer has made it clear that they are still working on content and functionality. There are also some slight quirks with the localization that could probably be ironed out with more time in the oven. Finally, the game doesn't natively support controllers.  That all being said, I still recommend MiSide. Lots of fun and interesting lore to discover, the overarching story is fun and interesting... It's all ""good"". But more time in the oven would make it ""great"".  I finished the main story in approximately 4 hours, reaching the ""true"" ending.

The lack of proper controller support does make it a bit clumsy on the Deck, but overall runs really well on it. The game is really good, definitely has Doki Doki vibes going on (so if you liked that game, you'll probably like this one too). I like how simple it is but how deep it gets, you think you got it figured out and then things get dark pretty quickly. It does a great job of subverting your expectations I feel. I think that makes the jump scares more effective because you're not expecting them. I mean in general I feel jump scares are a cheap (overused) trick in horror games but when you're playing a game that isn't a traditional horror like MiSide. Yeah, that can still get you.

I went for the 100% at the same day bc I was locked in, havent played a game inna while that made me want to play it more and btw, this was my first ever 100% on any game <3  I hope the peaceful mode allows you to hug her more :I bc from the description it sounds so cute, maybe allowing to do activities? like going on a walk outside or moving into a town? cinema? I do pay for a DLC no questions asked.   10/10 keep it up <3",0,0.5,76561199696497181,9.7,28

The devs are awesome and after the demo launched, they made sure to listen to everyone's wants and needs for the game.  The Demo does not do the actual game justice, the actual game skyrockets the demo and its crazy how much time and effort was put into small details. Its hard to find an anime-style horror game that actually captures and encapsulates the true meaning of horror. Getting chased, followed, dead-silent and pitch black ambiance, really gives you that feeling of anxiety and fear... Moments after you've just experienced a traumatic moment, you're often met with bright and soft colors accompanied by melodic music. It almost feels like a reward and a grace period after almost getting decapitated by a chainsaw wielding overly-attached girlfriend. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's into horror and the occasional soft-core dating sim (especially Doki Doki)  10/10   [spoiler] RIP Kind Mita. Would clap Sleepy Mita [/spoiler]",0,0.5,76561198115237873,9.3,0
