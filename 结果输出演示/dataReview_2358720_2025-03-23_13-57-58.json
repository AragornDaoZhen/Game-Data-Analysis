The game is tough but not as punishing as a Souls game, especially since dying doesn't come with much of a penalty. The combat feels amazing, and the boss fights are epic. I actually like that it's not fully open-world since I'm not a huge fan of exploring, although those invisible walls can be a bit weird at times. Plus, without a quest tracker a fully open world would probably be too overwhelming. Overall it's a great single-player experience. My two main complaints are that I wish there was more endgame content and replayability, and I’d like a bit more lore and story details, since it can feel a bit random at times.",

            "review": "[h2][b]An Experience like Journey To The West And More![/b][/h2]\n\nSteam needs to make a Gamer Profile of this game. Instant Buy! Black Myth: Wukong is not just a game, it’s a work of art. This was my first purchase on Steam and the reason I got back into gaming after a long hiatus. Games like this and God of War: Ragnarok remind you just how EPIC gaming can be. My deepest gratitude goes to [b]Game Science Studio[/b] for they’ve won me over with just one game, and now I’m eagerly awaiting their next project. This was my Game of the Year for 2024, and I’m pretty sure it was for the majority of real players too. Easter Developers, more specifically Chinese & Taiwanese developers are upping their game with masterpieces like this. [b]Wuchang: Fallen Feathers[/b] & [b]Tides of Annihilation[/b] are gonna come out this year for which I can't freaking wait! ʕʘ̅͜ʘ̅ʔ\n\nTo those complaining about this game's difficulty, they probably didn’t get past the Yellow Wind Sage (King). My advice? [b]Git Gud[/b]. I completed this masterpiece three times (NG+ and NG++) and snagged my 100% achievement by the second play-through. After decades of disappointing games based on Sun Wukong, this was the DESTINED ONE! Never have I been so passionate and invested in something the way I am with this game, its story, and the legendary tale it’s based on Journey to the West. It blends elements from Daoism, Buddhism, and even Confucianism, some explicit, others subtle. This legendary novel is not only a household name in China, where it’s been adapted into TV series, films, cartoons, and animations, but it has also profoundly influenced neighbouring East Asian countries. And now, it has left its definitive mark on the video game industry too.\n\nThis is where the game truly shines with its ambition. The sheer number of unique fights feels really, really damn special. So many times, I found myself in a glorious, over-the-top, brutal battle with screen-filling animations and explosions, thinking, “Oh man, this has to be the climax of the chapter or sequence. Maybe I’ll get a big cut-scene or something.” And then, after finally defeating the boss, nope—turns out that was just a regular pedestrian boss chilling in the middle of the level, with another one waiting right around the corner. The audacity! The scale! The sheer Wukong energy of it all!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the [b]breathtaking animations[/b] and [b]soundtracks[/b] that play after each chapter. Like, HOLY F*! Just when you think the game can’t get any better, it always exceeds your expectations. For those who don’t understand Chinese, most of the subtitles are lost in translation. The characters speak in [b]poetic, Classical Chinese, filled with idioms and elegance that’s beautifully done[/b]. I could hear the narrator lull me to sleep, that’s how much I love this freaking game. It’s a game that can truly be considered a work of art.\n\nTake the Purple Cloud Mountain area, for example, it's my favourite zone. It’s filled with gorgeous autumn forests and rocky mountains that make you want to meditate there for the rest of your life. And the soundtrack? So meditative, so good , I had to make a Spotify playlist out of it:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/6cbi4GxzrcfaCkJTNjJ581?si=20b11a64f8674fca\n\nAnd the good news is that Black Myth Wukong is getting two DLCs before Game Science’s next game. I hope it releases soon because initially this game was gonna have around 12-13 chapters but they had to shorten it to 6 which still had humongous content but not enough to satiate my desire for more Wukong. I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT!!",

Incredible hard work has been dedicated for this game to run the way it does. the game is also VERY FORGIVING. if u spent the wrong points? get it back. if u crafted the wrong item? get a refund. but if you bought the wrong item, LOL too bad ! \n\nthe game gives you unlimited lives and tries to perfect your craft. the vast amount of skill point modification alongside an arsenal of different gears to mix and match with is an art in itself. \n\ni dont really write much reviews, nor do i buy games at TODAYS PRICE without discounts. But this game? i happily paid full and would do it over and over again. \n\nwhat captivated me the most: the exceptional visuals, sounds and cutscenes. the seemless gameplay and just overall mechanics was a resounding 5 stars for me. \n\nthank you devs for introducing some of the chinese mythical stories for all to see. it is by far the best experience ive had with a game in a very very very long while. \n\n(my hours, although not many, im still on chapter 3 of 6 during time of comment. its down packed with content!).",

INSANE fun epic and beautiful game that makes you play instead of watching (though smtimes you stop and see how beautiful chinese culture and architecture can be) . 10/10 masterpiece for me, prob 9/10 objectively cuz 1. places that seem walkable sometimes have invisible barrier, as a way for the game to tell you that you cant go there (personally no issue with that technically should prob be altered). 2. game should have a map. Though it's linear (and i pref that approach) levels are kinda complex meaning there are extra little areas with items and stuff and a map would help you get on track after exploring them.",

The game’s mythological yet the environments are a feast for the eyes, and the enemy designs are both beautiful and nightmarish. Boss fights are a brutal test of skill and patience—think Dark Souls on a bad day—where every victory feels like pure euphoria. Despite being single-player, it’s surprisingly fun to play with a friend watching; their cheers, bad advice, and laughs when you get demolished add a weirdly social twist to the experience. The game constantly rewards perseverance, but it’s not for the faint of heart—button-mashers beware. Whether it’s discovering new abilities or finally nailing a boss’s pattern, **Black Myth: Wukong** delivers that rare mix of fun, rage, and triumph that keeps you thinking about it long after you put down the controller.",

It is not a game trying to copy-paste from other game. It is its OWN game, with its own style, which is why it really deserve GOTY of 2024 (and yet failed to get it).\n\n[Bad]\n1. Performance optimization is an issue for this game. I got a 4090 and still ran into frame drop. Mid-range PC probably will get 60 FPS with frame-gen ON.\n2. When frame-gen is ON, you will find very-hard to perform a PERFECT dodge. The dodge delay is significant (caused by frame-gen). \n3. Erlang can beat your ass for couple of hours, or days. Erlang is a well-designed boss in terms of background, visual and storyline. However, me personally do not find the fight and combat with Erlang to be fun. Without a \"PROPER SETUP\", you will find very constantly discouraging when facing Erlang's parry-bar. I do beat him in a couple of trys, as a Souls-like game veteran. However, I believe many players will be struggling with him without looking up \"How-to-beat him\" online. I believe his parry system need to change a little bit (for example, reduce the size of the parry bar).\n\n\n",

I love the intro part where you actually do get to play as Wukong, but that's the best you will get to hear from him. For me Wukongs speech along with his amazing personality is what makes him such an amazing character that has held up through history, and the developers of this game decided that it be too much work to have Wukong talk through the whole game. It really make me sad because I really just don't care for the story as much because I don't truly get to play as the monkey king. The game play itself is pretty good, but overall very easy, I beat most of the bosses on my first try. I guess I was hoping it would be a little more on par with souls like difficulty,  but its pretty straight forward overall. By far the biggest problem with this game is how poorly optimized this game really is. I had many graphical bugs throughout my whole play through, and if I left the game idle for more than two minutes it would be a guaranteed crash. It makes me kinda sad that this game will probably make it seem fine to not have a well optimized game for future games. Overall good game, not a good game for me at all.",

As a 44-year-old gamer, I play games to escape from my daily work routine—to relax and have fun, not to become even more stressed. Instead of being an enjoyable experience, this game feels more like a test of patience. If you're looking for a challenging Souls-like experience, this might be for you. But if you're just looking to unwind, be prepared for a frustrating ride.",

There were even freezes sometimes where I missed seeing large a large part of enemy attacks. Also, there are invisible walls everywhere that don't match up with the terrain. Finally, this game is extremely cryptic in the wrong places. Towards the end of the game, there is a stat checker that's functionality is very unclear and functionality lacking and is necessary to bypass in order to complete the story. Many players that weren't using the internet probably wasted a bunch of time here or even quit altogether. And the secret \"quests\" are very unclear, again begging for internet usage. The combat and boss variety are incredible though, even if some animations were a bit wonky or some enemy attack hitboxes were misaligned.",

I had watched gameplay videos on YouTube/Twitch, and it looked incredible because of its graphics and gameplay. After playing it, it's even more amazing than just watching it. The visual quality is stunning, with high-level textures (even without playing on the highest settings), packed with details, and featuring gameplay full of possibilities. Extremely fun and challenging.\r\n\r\nThe only gameplay-related criticism I have is the use of items to reduce the difficulty of (almost impossible) story bosses. I had to watch a YouTube video to get the \"Weaver's Needle\" after repeatedly failing the second phase of the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, which was quite frustrating.\r\nGraphically, the biggest issue is the excessive number of invisible walls in the game. \r\n\r\nOther than that, I find the game incredible and highly recommend it if you're looking for a challenging experience.",
